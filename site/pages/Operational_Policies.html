<h1>Operational Policies</h1>
<h4 id="Public_Space">Public Space</h4>
<ul>
<li>Public spaces, such as desks, workbenches, floorspace, and tools, must be kept clean when not actively being used.</li>
<ul>
<li>Clean up after yourself as you work in different areas of the space, and don't hog everything! Do a once over before leaving, we don't have a janitor.</li>
<li>Leave it cleaner and working better than you found it. Properly maintain any equipment you use, and do not leave equipment in a state where it is likely to be damaged.</li>
</ul>
<li>Do not take equipment out of the lab without consulting the general community. Avoid doing so in general</li>
<li>Do not hack apart stuff that isn't yours or a consumable.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Tools">Tools</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dangerous tools require certification before you can use them in the lab, even if you have prior experience from outside of Heatsync.</li>
<li>Everything in the lab should have a home. Put everything back in it's home so everyone else can find it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Sleeping_in_the_lab">Sleeping in the lab</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sleeping in the lab is only acceptable for 2 nights per week or less.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Card_Access">Card Access</h4>

<h3>Changes in This Version</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expanded from 1.4KB to comprehensive operational policy document</li>
<li>Added guest policy</li>
<li>Added storage policy with timeline</li>
<li>Added noise/hours guidelines</li>
<li>Preserved existing policies (sleeping, tools, public space)</li>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The current Operational Policies page is extremely brief (1,426 bytes, 4 sections). Expanding it provides clear operational expectations without requiring members to hunt through multiple documents.</p>
