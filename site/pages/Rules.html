<h3 id="Eligibility">Eligibility</h3>
<p>HeatSync membership is open to the public, but use of certain equipment and key/security code may require further training, certification or approvals. We do not discriminate based on age (providing that the user is capable of operating the tool, a minor may need to be accompanied by a parent for liability reasons but may still become certified), gender, sexual preference, race, religion, or geek factor.</p>

<p>More than anything else, membership is a regular donation. Its is NOT payment for a service.</p>

<p><strong>Teachers get 50% off any membership.</strong> Sign up as normal, just make your payments for the discount rate.</p>

<h3 id="Membership_Fees">Membership Fees</h3>
<p>If you sign up for membership via PayPal, your recurring monthly dues will be subtracted from your account the same date you enrolled. If you chose Cash/Check -- you can either mail your dues (108 West Main St. Mesa, AZ 85201) or deliver it to the current treasurer (treasurer @ heatsynclabs.org) at HeatSync. Please note recurring payments are -highly- encouraged-- remember we do not have staff. If cash/check are important please consider using your bank's automatic bill-pay feature, or prepaying for 3, 6 or 12 months up front.  <strong>Note:</strong> Membership fees are nonrefundable.</p>

<h3 id="Membership_and_Equipment">Membership and Equipment</h3>

<p>The equipment in the lab, and the supplies necessary to keep equipment in operation, are the responsibility of the members of Heatsync Labs. Supplies, materials, and other consumables, are kept in stock to the extent that members purchase them for the lab.</p>

<p>Consumables such as stock, drill/mill bits, adhesives,etc are NOT a right of membership.  Many consumables are available in the shop but are expected to be refilled by members, or not be available.  Spare stock from projects may be stored in the space and is encouraged to be used--and refilled.</p>

<h3 id="Good_Standing">Good Standing</h3>
<p>A member shall be considered in good standing if they are current on their dues or on a current board-approved scholarship.</p>

<p>If a member fails to pay their dues in a given month, HSL will make a good faith effort to contact them for resolution.</p>

<p>If the member refuses to pay their dues, membership will be immediately terminated. If they have a storage box/locker, they will be given 30 days to claim its contents, after which the contents will be donated to charity.</p>

<p>If the member is unreachable and/or does not respond to HSL's contact efforts within 60 days, a second contact will be attempted. If they are still unreachable and/or unresponsive after an additional 30 days, the contents of their storage box/locker will be donated to charity.</p>

<p><strong>See <a href="CNC_Mill.html">CNC Mill</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>HeatSync Training, or other formal training plus a basic HSL "test-out", required for use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mill rules apply to CNC Mill</li>
<li>Do not leave the mill unattended. Stay within reach of the emergency stop button at all times while running.</li>
<li>Preview all milling jobs before running on the machine.</li>
<li>DO NOT hand-edit your G-code programs.</li>
<li>TODO: Add more safety & maintenance rules</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Getting_Started_Resources">Getting Started Resources</h4>
<p>If you'd like to use the CNC Mill, we are still working on a class but we have identified some things you'll need to learn first. So, you can get started right now on your own! <strong>Keep in mind these are intended as e-learning preparation for an eventual class, not as a substitute for hands-on training.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Multiple hours of Mill and 3D printer experience will be invaluable if not mandatory, because all the "gotchas" of both machines are present in a CNC Mill.</li>
<li>Ability to read G-code and M-code. The codes scroll by as the mill runs your program, and if there's any problem you'll need to have a basic understanding in order to troubleshoot things. There's only a couple dozen, so it's not too hard.</li>
<li>* Some starter resources I found while googling:</li>

<li>** http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=CNC+Basics+E-Course</li>
<li>** http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cnc+g-code</li>
<li>Try using CAD/CAM programs like Solidworks with HSMXpress, or other CAD programs with CamBam, to design a part and generate GCode for it.</li>

<li>** http://www.instructables.com/id/From-SketchUp-to-CNC-Fabrication/</li>
<li>Try using Mach3 - it's the program that directly controls the CNC machine based on the GCode you've made - free trial from here: http://www.machsupport.com/</li>

<li>Before finishing, tin the tip fully to prevent oxidation when not in use</li>
<li>Never leave iron on and not in use for long periods of time</li>
<li>Keep hot surfaces away from burnable, meltable, or injurable areas.</li>
<li>When using hot air reflow, avoid extended low speed airflow and high temperature, as the unit can overheat.</li>
<li>Utilize the air filter, if available, on your iron to protect you from solder/flux fumes or only solder in well ventilated rooms</li>

<h3>Changes in This Version</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added enforcement ladder (verbal warning -&gt; written warning -&gt; suspension -&gt; termination)</li>
<li>Added equipment damage reporting procedure</li>
<li>Consolidated scattered safety rules into unified structure</li>
<li>Added cross-references to Bylaws for membership and card access</li>
<li>Improved table of contents and navigation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The Rules document is comprehensive (116 revisions of organic growth) but lacks a clear enforcement mechanism and damage reporting procedure. The enforcement ladder provides consistent, fair consequences while the damage reporting encourages transparency rather than hiding accidents.</p>

<h3 id="certification-requirements">Certification Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>All dangerous tools require HeatSync Labs certification</strong>, even if you have outside experience. Our equipment may have specific quirks, limitations, or procedures.</p>
<p>Certification is earned by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attending a scheduled training class, OR</li>
<li>Receiving one-on-one training from a certified member</li>

<h3>Changes in This Version</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added enforcement ladder (verbal warning -&gt; written warning -&gt; suspension -&gt; termination)</li>
<li>Added equipment damage reporting procedure</li>
<li>Consolidated scattered safety rules into unified structure</li>
<li>Added cross-references to Bylaws for membership and card access</li>
<li>Improved table of contents and navigation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The Rules document is comprehensive (116 revisions of organic growth) but lacks a clear enforcement mechanism and damage reporting procedure. The enforcement ladder provides consistent, fair consequences while the damage reporting encourages transparency rather than hiding accidents.</p>

<div class="diff-del">-* Do not run the blade too fast for the material </div>
<div class="diff-del">-** Highest speed is only suitable for aluminum (with coolant)</div>
<div class="diff-del">-** Avoiding hardened materials.  Unknown steel alloys should be tested with a file. Avoid cutting ends that have been discolored (hardened) by heat.</div>
<div class="diff-del">-* There is no danger in going too slow, so when unsure, go with the slowest speed.</div>
<div class="diff-del">-* Use the appropriate type of blade (fine versus coarse teeth)</div>
<div class="diff-del">-* '''Bandsaw blade longevity tip''' Blades should always have AT LEAST three teeth engaged in the cut, actively cutting. So, for example, if the blade on the saw is 14tpi, then 3/14 = 0.214&quot; thick material minimum. When possible, you should cut multiple pieces stacked together to try to achieve the minimum thickness for the blade, even backing-up the cut with sacrificial material works. </div>
<div class="diff-del">-** If you decide to proceed with too-thin material anyway, care must be taken to feed the material into the blade slowly and gently, if it's fed aggressively, one tooth will try to take a full 3/4hp cut and will probably just shear off from the blade itself, especially with the cheap-blade that ships with the saw.</div>

<div class="diff-del">-* Always keep the vertical tray on the machine.(picture)</div>
<div class="diff-del">-* Always let the blade do the cutting.  Never force it or apply pressure on the chassis to force the cut.</div>
