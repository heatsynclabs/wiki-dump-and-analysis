<p>Financial report</p>

<p>Jake Rosenthal requests that we pump up the jams before the financial report</p>
<ul>
<li>We our large corporate donor this year after about a year of donations</li>
<li>Membership needs audit, people not paying what they have on our books.</li>
<ul>
<li>Keeping track of people who pay cash, might be time to move away from cash payments altogether. Dwolla, Paypal, Amazon Payments, mailed checks.</li>

<h3 id="Jacob_Rosenthal">Jacob Rosenthal</h3>

<p>The era of "when does HeatSync buy that" is over for now, due to the loss of our corporate sponsor. The community will have to realize that we need to start funding our own projects and tool acquisitions again</p>

<h3 id="Motion_by_Jeremy_Leung">Motion by Jeremy Leung</h3>

<p>"Motion to have our official board meeting be moved to once a year on the first member meeting in April."</p>

<p>The last two to three meetings, we have had no new business, lack of attendance by the membership. All of the day to day has been pushed to the bi-weekly hack your hackerspace meetings, which is a Good Thing, because the community has more of a say.</p>

<p>Given that, Jeremy believes we can move our meetings to once a year. The membership can call a special meeting any time of the year they would like. This would more than cover what we need to get the board business taken care of.</p>

<p>Jeremy Leung asks for a minute discussion per board member to bring discussion to public</p>

<h4 id="Jose_Diaz">Jose Diaz</h4>

<p>Yields his time</p>

<h4 id="Will_Bradley">Will Bradley</h4>

<p>Will thinks the meetings are a good thing. feels that moving the meeting to once a year, would lessen the board's ability to take vision and guidence of the space seriously.</p>

<h4 id="Ryan_Rix">Ryan Rix</h4>

<p>Ryan feels like moving to a single meeting is positive, as long as it doesn't keep us from talking and meeting and having that board conversation outside of that meeting. We only need to have an official meeting once, but can talk about board stuff all the time.</p>

<h4 id="Jake_Rosenthal">Jake Rosenthal</h4>

<p>Feels like there should be a stronger argument that we should be meeting more than once a year but has not heard it yet.</p>

<h4 id="Member_Tim_Gerrits">Member Tim Gerrits</h4>
<p>Asks what our legal requirements are for the meeting, whether we will miss our yearly requirement if poorly planned, will there be quorom, etc.</p>

<p>Jeremy says that having the meeting in April would keep us in line legally.</p>

<h4 id="Vote">Vote</h4>

<p>We do not have unanimous consent for this vote.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jose: For</li>
<li>Will: Against</li>
<li>Ryan: For</li>
<li>Jake: For</li>
<li>Jeremy: For</li>
</ul>
<p>Motion passes.</p>
