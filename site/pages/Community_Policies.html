<h3>Changes in This Version</h3>
<ul>
<li>New document absorbing Card Access and Proposal Process from Bylaws</li>
<li>Reformed card access: 1-month cooldown on failed nomination instead of 6-12 month lockout</li>
<li>Reformed card access: nominator not locked out on failed nomination</li>
<li>Reformed card access: removed 1 nomination per year per card member restriction</li>
<li>Added clear guidance on what a no vote should be based on</li>
<li>Added nominee feedback mechanism for failed nominations</li>
<li>Reduced proposal resubmission lockout from 6 months to 3 months</li>
<li>Amendable by simple HYH majority vote (no Board ratification required)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The previous Bylaws embedded operational policies (card access, proposal process) directly, requiring the formal bylaws amendment process to change them. Moving these to a separate Community Policies document allows the community to iterate on these processes by simple HYH majority vote. The card access reforms address punitive nomination rules that locked both nominator and nominee for 6-12 months on a failed vote, discouraging nominations and community growth.</p>

    <div class="improved-content">
      <h1 id="heatsync-labs-community-policies">HeatSync Labs Community Policies</h1>
<p>These policies govern community processes at HeatSync Labs. Per the <a href="Bylaws.html">Bylaws</a>, Article VIII, Community Policies are adopted and amended by majority vote at a Hack Your Hackerspace (HYH) meeting. They do not require Board ratification.</p>
<h2 id="1--card-access">1. Card Access</h2>
<p>Having card access to the lab is both a privilege and a responsibility. Card access is based on trust, not a "right" of membership. Having card access means that the individual understands and respects the rules of the lab and is willing to abide by the <a href="Community_Standards.html">Community Standards</a> and <a href="Rules.html">Rules</a>.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-eligibility">1.1 Eligibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must be a paying member at the Basic ($50/month) or higher tier, in good standing, for a minimum of two (2) consecutive months.</li>
<li>Must have attended at least one HYH meeting or spent time at the space during staffed hours so the community can be introduced to the individual.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-2-nomination">1.2 Nomination</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any current card access member may nominate an eligible non-card member.</li>
<li>The nominator agrees to serve as <strong>mentor</strong> for the nominee during a six (6) month probationary period. Mentorship means being available to answer questions, model good practices, and help the new card member integrate into the community.</li>
<li>There is no limit on how many nominations a card member may make.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-3-proposal">1.3 Proposal</h3>
<ul>
<li>The nomination shall be posted publicly on HeatSync Labs' communication channels (currently Google Groups and Slack) with a clear subject line (e.g., "Proposal: Card Access for [Name]") at least two (2) weeks before the HYH meeting.</li>
<li>The proposal must include an introduction of the nominee to the community.</li>
<li>The nominator <strong>must</strong> be present at the HYH meeting to introduce the nominee (if necessary) and answer questions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-4-approval">1.4 Approval</h3>
<ul>
<li>Card access is voted on exclusively by current card access members.</li>
<li>A minimum of five (5) card access members must be present for a valid vote.</li>
<li>Approval requires a majority vote of card members present.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-5-what-a--no--vote-should-be-based-on">1.5 What a "No" Vote Should Be Based On</h3>
<p>A "no" vote on a card access nomination should be based on <strong>concrete safety or trust concerns</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observed unsafe behavior in the space</li>
<li>History of not following lab rules or community norms</li>
<li>Concerns about the nominee's ability to be responsible for the space unsupervised</li>
<li>Unresolved conflicts that affect the community's trust</li>
</ul>
<p>A "no" vote should <strong>not</strong> be based on personal dislike, personality differences, or characteristics unrelated to the nominee's ability to be a responsible card member. If you have concerns, raising them during the discussion period (before the vote) is encouraged.</p>
<h3 id="1-6-failed-nominations">1.6 Failed Nominations</h3>
<p>If a card access nomination fails:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>nominee</strong> may be re-nominated after a one (1) month waiting period. The re-nomination may be made by any card member, not necessarily the original nominator.</li>
<li>The <strong>nominator</strong> is not locked out. They may nominate a different person immediately.</li>
<li>The nominee may request <strong>anonymized feedback</strong> from the Board on why the nomination failed, so they can address concerns before re-nomination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-7-revocation">1.7 Revocation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Card access may be revoked by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of card access members present at an HYH meeting (minimum five present).</li>
<li>Card access may be revoked immediately by the Board in emergency situations involving safety concerns or Community Standards violations.</li>
<li>Card access is automatically terminated if the member cancels their membership or lowers their membership below the Basic tier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2--proposal-process">2. Proposal Process</h2>
<p>HeatSync Labs has a proposal process so that changes to the space are made thoughtfully and with input from the community. It gives members a way to suggest ideas, discuss them openly, and make sure they are practical before being put to a vote.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-proposal-submission">2.1 Proposal Submission</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any active, paying member in good standing may submit a proposal.</li>
<li>The individual submitting the proposal must be its owner and responsible party. Proposals may not be submitted on behalf of another person unless they explicitly agree to take ownership.</li>
<li>Proposals must be posted to HeatSync Labs' communication channels (currently Google Groups) for open discussion and feedback.</li>
<li>Proposals must be submitted at least <strong>nine (9) days</strong> before an HYH meeting to be eligible for voting.</li>
<li>The proposal must include:</li>
<li>The specific change or project being proposed</li>
<li>The reason for the proposal and expected benefits</li>
<li>Estimated costs and resource requirements (if applicable)</li>
<li>The timeline for implementation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-2-discussion-and-refinement--9-day-period">2.2 Discussion and Refinement (9-Day Period)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Members provide public feedback before the HYH meeting.</li>
<li>Members are encouraged to provide substantive feedback rather than just "+1" or "I agree."</li>
<li>The proposer may adjust the proposal based on discussion, but <strong>no further changes may be made within one week of the HYH meeting.</strong></li>
<li>The final version must be clearly posted and locked in the communication channel at least one week before the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-3-consideration-at-hyh-meeting">2.3 Consideration at HYH Meeting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proposals are automatically considered at the HYH meeting if they have been discussed for 9 days.</li>
<li>The proposer must add it to the agenda and verbally introduce the proposal during the meeting.</li>
<li>If the proposer fails to mention or remind the group about the proposal, it will not be eligible for a vote and must be deferred to the next HYH meeting.</li>
<li>The proposer must provide a brief summary before the vote.</li>
<li>If a quorum is not present (minimum <strong>eight (8)</strong> paying members), the vote is deferred to the next HYH meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-4-voting">2.4 Voting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only paying members in good standing are eligible to vote.</li>
<li>A proposal passes with a majority vote of those voting (abstentions do not count toward the total).</li>
<li>A quorum requires at least eight (8) paying members present, but only votes cast count toward the outcome.</li>
<li>Ties result in no action; the proposal does not pass.</li>
<li>Voting results must be posted to HeatSync Labs' communication channels within seven (7) days of the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-5-resubmission-restrictions">2.5 Resubmission Restrictions</h3>
<p>If a proposal fails, it cannot be resubmitted for <strong>three (3) months</strong>, unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposer makes <strong>substantial changes</strong>, and the members present at an HYH meeting vote to allow early reconsideration.</li>
<li>To be eligible for early reconsideration, the proposer must clearly outline new information or significant changes before members vote on whether it should return to the agenda.</li>
<li>The vote for reconsideration may be held four (4) weeks after the reconsideration request is made.</li>
<li><strong>Substantial change examples:</strong></li>
<li>A significant reduction or expansion in scope addressing major concerns</li>
<li>Securing external funding that eliminates previous financial concerns</li>
<li><strong>Not</strong> minor wording tweaks or slight budget reallocations</li>
<li>A similar proposal that only modifies minor details will be treated as a duplicate and not placed on the agenda until the restriction period expires.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-6-implementation-and-follow-up">2.6 Implementation and Follow-Up</h3>
<ul>
<li>The proposer is responsible for overseeing implementation.</li>
<li>The proposer must provide regular updates via communication channels or during HYH meetings.</li>
<li>If additional resources, approvals, or Board oversight are required, the proposer must work with the appropriate parties.</li>
<li>If the proposer fails to begin implementation within three (3) months of the stated start date, the proposal may be reassigned, modified, or canceled by member consensus at an HYH meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-7-proposal-considerations-checklist">2.7 Proposal Considerations Checklist</h3>
<p>When submitting a proposal, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building impact:</strong> Electrical, ventilation, floor space, water requirements</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing costs:</strong> Maintenance, repairs, consumables</li>
<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Cleaning responsibilities, training requirements, integration with classes</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Zoning laws, safety codes, lease agreements, insurance</li>
<li><strong>Mission alignment:</strong> Does this support HeatSync Labs' mission as a creative and educational space?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3--amendments">3. Amendments</h2>
<p>These Community Policies may be amended by majority vote at a Hack Your Hackerspace (HYH) meeting, following the standard proposal process defined in Section 2. Per the <a href="Bylaws.html">Bylaws</a>, Article VIII, Community Policies amendments do not require Board ratification.</p>
