# History of HeatSync Labs Governance

An analysis of how HeatSync Labs' governance structures evolved from 2009 to 2026,
traced through 63 Bylaws revisions, 116 Rules revisions, and dozens of supporting
governance documents.

---

## Phase 1: Founder-Driven (2009-2010)

### Initial Structure

The original Bylaws (December 28, 2009, 9,300 bytes) established:

- Arizona nonprofit corporation
- Board of Directors governance
- Basic membership structure
- Purpose: mutual self-education and enrichment

The founding document was drafted by an anonymous contributor (IP 65.103.203.33),
suggesting an informal founding group working from shared internet access (likely
at Gangplank, the Phoenix coworking space where early maker meetups were held).

### Board-Heavy Governance

Board meetings were frequent and documented:

- Board:12 July 2012 Meeting (2012-07-13)
- Board:12 July 2012 Meeting (2012-07-13)
- Board:11 April 2013 Meeting (2013-05-14)
- Board:23 May 2013 Meeting (2013-05-28)

The biweekly meeting cadence and detailed minutes suggest a traditional
board-of-directors model with formal decision-making processes.

## Phase 2: Community Governance Emerges (2011-2013)

### Rules Explosion

The Rules page was created November 17, 2010 with basic safety rules (2,097 bytes).
It underwent rapid expansion:

- **2010-11-17**: Grew to 2,097B (98.177.240.110) - Created page with '==General Space Safety Rules==  ===Genera
- **2011-01-15**: Grew to 6,212B (Will) - /* Membership Guidelines */
- **2011-03-16**: Grew to 14,175B (Will) - 
- **2013-09-03**: Grew to 21,392B (Lc) - /* Clothing */
- **2025-10-02**: Final state 19,673B (Jaymcgavren)

### Hack Your Hackerspace (HYH)

The HYH process emerged as a defining governance innovation. Rather than top-down
board decisions, HYH meetings allowed any member to propose changes. This shifted
decision-making from the board to the community.

Key HYH milestones:
- **September 2012**: Dedicated "Hack Your Hackerspace" governance discussion
- **December 2012**: HYH Meeting documented community governance processes
- **February 2013**: Continued HYH development

The "How to Run HeatSync Labs" guide (created around 2012) explicitly states the
board's role is to "guide the community" and "empower individuals," not to dictate.

### Board Meeting Decline

Board: namespace pages end in mid-2013, coinciding with the HYH process maturing.
This suggests governance successfully transitioned from board-centric to community-centric.

**Note:** The wiki reportedly had ~37 board meeting pages; only
4 survive in this dump, suggesting some institutional memory was lost
to page deletions.

## Phase 3: Operational Maturity (2014-2020)

### Policy Documentation

This period saw governance shift from structural questions to operational detail:

- **Operational Policies** (2014): Formalized day-to-day rules
  - Public space cleanliness standards
  - Tool certification requirements
  - Sleeping policy (max 2 nights/week)
  - Card access voting rules

- **Procedures** (2016+): Step-by-step administrative guides
  - New member onboarding
  - Payment processing (Square)
  - Equipment certification tracking
  - Purchase request workflow

- **Access Card Procedure** (2014): Technical documentation for RFID access
  management, showing the nuts-and-bolts of physical access control via
  SSH/minicom serial interface

### Stable Board Structure

Board positions consolidated into four roles:
1. **Champion** (later Co-Champions) - primary contact, vision keeper
2. **Treasurer** - finances, banking, taxes, building management
3. **Secretary** - communications, compliance, documentation
4. **Operations** - volunteers, membership, facilities, safety

Earlier specialized roles (PR/Marketing, Event Coordinator, Fundraising Coordinator,
Editor, Resource Manager) were marked obsolete, reflecting a move toward broader
role definitions.

## Phase 4: Major Overhaul (2024-2026)

### Bylaws Growth

The most significant governance changes since founding:

- **2009-12-28**: 9,300B (65.103.203.33) - Created page with '== HeatSync Labs Bylaws ==  I.NAME AND PURPOSE  1.The name of
- **2010-02-18**: 11,530B (64.130.243.194) - /* ORGANIZATION */
- **2018-05-03**: 20,209B (Milton.jay.williams) - /* CODE OF CONDUCT */
- **2025-03-21**: 22,573B (Badtuffstuff) - /* MEMBERSHIP */
- **2025-03-21**: 30,898B (Badtuffstuff) - /* CODE OF CONDUCT */

### New Sections Added (2024-2025)

The Bylaws grew from ~9KB to **30.6KB** with major new sections:

#### Card Access (new section)
- Eligibility: 2+ months membership at $50+/month level
- Nomination: existing card member sponsors candidate
- Public proposal period with community introduction
- Vote: minimum 5 card members present, majority required
- Mentor system: nominators responsible for nominees for 6 months
- One nomination per year per member
- Revocation process with 2/3 card access member majority

#### Proposal Process (new section)
- 9-day discussion period: 2 days submission, 5 days discussion, 2 days voting
- Voting at HYH meetings with minimum 5 voting members
- Failed proposals: 6-month waiting period before resubmission
- Temporary measures during discussion period

#### Code of Conduct (new section)
- Based on Geek Feminism community standards
- Defines acceptable and unacceptable behavior
- Enforcement procedures with escalating consequences
- Grievance process for disputes
- Addresses weapons policy (Arizona state law compliance)

#### Amendments Process
- Formal procedure for changing bylaws
- Ratification via community vote (December 2025 via Slack)

### Identified Governance Gaps

Despite the comprehensive 2025 overhaul, several governance best practices
are still missing from the current bylaws:

1. **Dissolution clause**: Required for 501(c)(3) status - must specify
   asset distribution to another exempt organization upon dissolution
2. **Fiscal year definition**: Not explicitly stated
3. **Virtual meeting provisions**: No provisions for remote participation
   (despite the Slack ratification precedent)
4. **Officer removal process**: No clear process for removing board members
   mid-term beyond the general termination provisions
5. **Insurance/indemnification**: No provisions for board member indemnification
