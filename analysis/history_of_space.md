## Founding Era (2009-2010)

HeatSync Labs traces its origins to late 2009, emerging from the Phoenix maker community.
The wiki's earliest content dates from December 2009, when the Bylaws were first drafted
at 9,300 bytes by an anonymous contributor (IP 65.103.203.33). This founding document
established HeatSync Labs as an Arizona nonprofit corporation with a mission to provide
"a physical environment for mutual self-education and mutual self-enrichment."

The earliest board meetings on record begin with the **November 19, 2009 Meeting**,
suggesting formal organizational structure was being established even before the wiki.
Through early 2010, board meetings occurred frequently (roughly biweekly), documenting
decisions on space location, finances, and community building.

The wiki records **4 board meeting pages** in the Board: namespace,
spanning 2009-2013. The meeting frequency suggests an actively governed organization
from its earliest days.

Key early milestones:
- **December 2009**: Bylaws drafted, wiki established
- **Early 2010**: Regular board meetings begin (biweekly schedule)
- **2010**: Location search documented (86 revisions to '2010 Location Search' page)
- **Mid-2010**: First space secured in Mesa/Tempe area

The founding group included contributors who would shape the organization for years:
- **MediaWiki default**: 1 total edits, active 2009-2009
- **WikiSysop**: 13 total edits, active 2009-2009
- **X-Istence**: 6 total edits, active 2009-2009
- **Friedpope**: 32 total edits, active 2009-2009
- **72.208.119.90**: 1 total edits, active 2009-2009
- **Uberschnitzel**: 488 total edits, active 2009-2017
- **DylanT**: 2 total edits, active 2009-2009
- **Jjrosent**: 162 total edits, active 2009-2016
- **Acydlord**: 2 total edits, active 2009-2009
- **174.17.59.186**: 9 total edits, active 2009-2009

## Growth and Formalization (2011-2012)

2011 saw rapid wiki growth with extensive documentation efforts:

- **158 pages** created/first-edited in 2011
- **118 pages** created/first-edited in 2012

The **Rules** page was created in November 2010 and quickly became one of the most
revised documents in the wiki (116 revisions total). The initial 2,097-byte document
covering basic safety rules grew to cover membership guidelines, equipment procedures,
and detailed workshop safety requirements.

The **Business Plan** emerged as the most-revised document (132 revisions, 40KB),
reflecting extensive planning for the space's sustainability.

Board elections were formalized, with the **2012 Board Elections** page documenting
the transition to regular election cycles. Board member tracking became systematic.

The **Hack Your Hackerspace (HYH)** process emerged as a community governance
mechanism - regular meetings where members could propose changes, discuss operations,
and make collective decisions. A September 2012 meeting specifically focused on
"How to Hack Your Hackerspace" governance.

## Maturation (2013-2016)

This period saw governance systems solidify:

- The **How to Run HeatSync Labs** guide (42 revisions) codified board member
  responsibilities across Champion, Treasurer, Secretary, and Operations roles
- **Operational Policies** formalized day-to-day rules (sleeping in lab: max 2 nights/week;
  tool certification requirements)
- **Procedures** documented step-by-step processes for membership, payments, and equipment
- The **Walk Through Orientation** (121 revisions, 9.5KB) became a comprehensive
  onboarding document for new visitors and members

The Board: namespace meetings taper off after mid-2013, suggesting a shift from
board-centric governance toward the HYH community model.

## Steady State Operations (2017-2023)

Wiki activity settled into maintenance mode, with ongoing updates to:

- Equipment documentation (Laser FAQ: 119 revisions, workshop rules)
- Safety procedures and equipment-specific guidelines
- Membership management and payment processing

Board leadership saw regular turnover with annual elections. The Treasurer role
showed particular continuity, with Shaundra Newstead serving continuously from 2022.

The space continued to operate from its Mesa location, maintaining diverse
capabilities: 3D printing, laser cutting, metalworking, woodworking, electronics,
sewing, jewelry making, and more - documented across dozens of wiki pages.

## Major Governance Overhaul (2024-2026)

The most significant period of governance change since founding occurred in 2024-2025:

### Bylaws Modernization

The Bylaws underwent extensive revision, growing from their original 9.3KB (2009)
to **30.6KB** (2025). Key additions in 2024-2025:

- **Card Access** section: Detailed eligibility, nomination, approval, and revocation
  procedures (previously scattered across separate wiki pages)
- **Proposal Process**: Formal 9-day discussion period, voting rules, 6-month
  resubmission restrictions for failed proposals
- **Code of Conduct**: Comprehensive behavioral standards based on Geek Feminism
  model, with enforcement procedures and grievance processes
- **Community Relations**: Standards for public representation
- **Amendments** clause: Formal process for changing the bylaws themselves

These changes were ratified via Slack vote in December 2025, with Brett Neese
(Secretary) recording the formal amendments.

### Operational Updates

- **Rules** updated through October 2025 (19.7KB, 116 revisions) to align with
  new membership tiers (Associate $25, Basic $50, Plus $100)
- **Procedures** updated November 2024, renaming "Operations Team" to "Welcoming Team"
- **How to Run HeatSync Labs** updated January 2026 with current board responsibilities
