# HeatSync Labs: Proposed Governance Structure

This folder contains proposed improvements to HeatSync Labs' governance documents, derived from analysis of the [wiki's full revision history](https://wiki.heatsynclabs.org) (939 pages, 5,419 revisions, 263 contributors, 2009-2026).

Each document includes a callout at the top listing exactly what changed and why. The substance of the original wiki documents is preserved — these drafts reorganize, clarify, and fill gaps rather than rewrite from scratch.

## Policy Hierarchy

The proposed structure organizes governance into four tiers, each with a different amendment threshold:

```
1. Bylaws                    (2/3 member vote + Board ratification)
   Foundation: legal structure, board standards, elections, dissolution

2. Community Standards       (majority vote at HYH)
   Code of conduct, accountability process, consequences, appeals

3. Community Policies        (majority vote at HYH)
   Card access process, proposal process, amendment rules

4. Operational Procedures    (Board or empowered volunteers)
   Day-to-day: onboarding, payments, equipment, facility ops
```

Higher-tier documents take precedence in case of conflict. Community Standards and Community Policies can be amended by simple HYH majority vote — no Board ratification required — so the community can iterate on its own norms without the higher bar needed for Bylaws changes.

## Documents

### Core (require formal amendment process)

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Bylaws](Bylaws.md) | Foundational legal framework — 10 articles covering board structure, elections, membership, meetings, dissolution |
| [Community Standards](Community_Standards.md) | Code of conduct & accountability process — tiered consequences, grievance committee, reporting procedures |
| [Community Policies](Community_Policies.md) | Card access process (reformed nomination/voting rules) and proposal process |

### Operational

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Rules](Rules.md) | Safety rules, equipment certification, workshop-specific rules, enforcement ladder |
| [Operational Policies](Operational_Policies.md) | Facility policies — guests, storage, sleeping, hours, card usage |
| [Procedures](Procedures.md) | Actionable checklists — onboarding, payments, equipment certification, purchases |

### Reference

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Board Members](Board_Members.md) | Current and past board members, elections process, role descriptions |
| [How to Run HeatSync Labs](How_to_Run_HeatSync_Labs.md) | Board member onboarding guide — role responsibilities, first-30-days checklists, annual calendar |
| [Access Card Procedure](Access_Card_Procedure.md) | Technical card issuance and deactivation procedure |
| [Proposals](Proposals.md) | When and how to submit proposals, proposal template |

## Key Improvements

- **Separated concerns**: Bylaws are now a lean legal framework. Operational policies (card access, proposals, code of conduct) moved to documents the community can amend by simple vote.
- **Card access reform**: Replaced punitive 6-12 month lockout on failed nominations with 1-month cooldown. Nominators no longer penalized for failed nominations.
- **Member empowerment**: Added Member-Called Special Elections (Article IV) — 8+ members can petition for a special election for any board seat, no misconduct allegation required.
- **Board standards**: Added Article III requiring board members to uphold inclusive environment standards.
- **Accountability process**: Replaced brief embedded Code of Conduct with comprehensive Community Standards including clear tiered consequences, investigation timelines, and grievance committee.
- **Enforcement ladder**: Rules now include progressive enforcement (warning -> written warning -> suspension -> termination).
- **Checklists**: Procedures reformatted as actionable checklists for volunteers.

## Status

These are **proposed drafts** for community discussion. No changes take effect until voted on through the existing governance process.
