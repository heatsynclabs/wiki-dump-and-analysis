> - Updated to reference current Bylaws proposal process
> - Added proposal template
> - Preserved historical proposal links
> - Added guidance on what requires a proposal vs. Board approval

> **Rationale:** The current Proposals page is outdated (last updated 2020) and doesn't reference the detailed Proposal Process now in the Bylaws. This update bridges that gap and provides a practical template for members.

# Proposals

## When is a Proposal Required?

Per the [Bylaws](Bylaws.md), formal proposals are required for:

- **Card access nominations** (new member card access)
- **Major equipment purchases** (over $500)
- **Permanent space modifications** (installations, layout changes)
- **Policy changes** (amendments to Rules, Policies, or Procedures)
- **Bylaw amendments** (follow the Amendments process in the Bylaws)

## Proposal Process

The full proposal process is defined in the [Community Policies](Community_Policies.md). Summary:

1. **Days 1-2:** Submit proposal to Slack and/or Google Group
2. **Days 3-7:** Community discussion period
3. **Days 8-9:** Vote at HYH meeting (minimum 8 paying members)
4. **Result:** Majority vote to pass; failed proposals cannot be resubmitted for 3 months (unless substantial changes are made and members vote to allow early reconsideration)
