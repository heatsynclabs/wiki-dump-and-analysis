<li>JR: Facilities/Official New Location Committee</li>
<ul>
<li>Results: 0 yes/11 no/4 abstain</li>
<li>Text: I propose we form a facilities committee. This committee shall consist of not more than 7 members of HSL,  and shall have the task of working with our landlord to address the inadequacies of our current location and/or finding a new location.  This committee shall report back no later than the HYH on April 26 with their recommended course of action.  The following members: Will Bradley, Jason Rziha, and Chad Stearns, having indicated they are willing to serve, are hereby appointed to the committee.  Other members who wish to serve may request and be appointed at future HYH's.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="Discussion_Items">Discussion Items</h2>

<ul>
<li>James: members generally agree that he is responsible, a valued contributor, and a nice/generous guy. Jeremy and Jacob commented that they would like to hear feedback like this on card votes rather than simply "he's cool" since responsibility and contributions are more important than simply being cool.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Facilities Committee: members generally agree that they want action on the facilities and agree with JR's vision, but that HSL's "doocracy" philosophy empowers JR to already do everything he proposes. JR countered that he simply wanted to get consensus and a mandate in public so as to avoid claims that things were done in secret, as happened with the recent wood shop committee. Will commented that he wants action, regardless of whether the proposal passes or not.</li>
