<p>We’re looking to venture out to cool places we hear about (in a totally informal way) one of the other Thursdays of the month. (probably going to be the 3rd one).  First up, I believe, is going to be Organ Stop Pizza. Feel free to bring the fam’, girlfriend/boyfriend, bestfriend/nemesis… whatever!</p>
