<h3 id="Notes_Captured_From_Eric_Wood_2022-08-23">Notes Captured From Eric Wood 2022-08-23</h3>

<ul>
<li>HSL has an accounting firm, which charges about $300 per month.</li>
<li>Most bills are auto-paid, but there are some manual outliers that need to be handled.</li>
<li>Payments to instructors:</li>
<ul>
<li>Money transfer from PayPal to Instructor done by Treasurer.</li>
<li>Recorded in QuickBooks by Treasurer.</li>
<li>Customer payments are collected in PayPal by Website.</li>
<li>Instructor provides info to Treasurer about financial breakdown.</li>
<li>Treasurer *does not* do 1099 - Accountant does that.</li>
<ul>
<li>Treasurer does categorize instructor payments in docs provided to accountant.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Reimbursements are paid by Treasurer.</li>
<ul>
<li>Receipts are stored primarily as images in DropBox.</li>
<li>Some noteworthy receipts are also kept as paper.</li>
</ul>
<li>Books are done in QuickBooks.</li>
<li>Member Database integration would be nice. (has been on the wish list for a long time)</li>
<li>Keep about $nn in checking account. (number known but not disclosed here, ask Eric)</li>
<ul>
<li>When checking goes below $nn, transfer money from savings.</li>
<li>Consider pinging Jim Tolar from Bike Saviours regarding using a CD ladder for improved interest.</li>
</ul>
<li>Currently we do not have a purchaser of paper towels and toilet paper, which should be expenses sent to Treasurer.</li>
<li>Rent is our highest expense at about $1/foot/month.</li>
<li>Electricity is our #2 expense.</li>
<li>Sprinklers are the big thing we don't want to do that makes us consider leaving our otherwise pleasant location. Estimate was $50k, but that included $25k to extend the City of Mesa water main, which may have been partially extended already. $50k is probably more like an upper bound right now.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="Operations">Operations</h2>

<p>The Operations manager should be good at inspiring volunteers, delegating, following up, and taking tasks on themselves as necessary. In order to be effective and to keep HeatSync a community-oriented endeavor, they should not attempt to do everything themselves or dictate policy. Rather, they should help community members reach a productive consensus and achieve common goals together, only rarely stepping in to make decisions when the community is deeply divided.</p>

<p>The operations manager delegates and coordinates ongoing tasks including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Membership (welcoming, tracking, training, card access, suspension/revocation)</li>
<li>Propose adjustments to the space or behavior to help newcomers feel welcomed and transition to a user of the space/tools, possibly a member, or possibly a volunteer.</li>
<li>Update and refine the Walk Through Orientation on a regular basis</li>
<li>Community Governance (community voting, mailing list moderation, mediation)</li>
<li>IT:</li>
<ul>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Wiki</li>
<li>Internet</li>
<li>Door Access</li>
<li>WiFi</li>
</ul>
<li>Marketing</li>
<ul>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>print</li>
<li>signage</li>
<li>t-shirts</li>
</ul>
<li>Facility Maintenance</li>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>At least yearly, audit the MSDS binder and update it to reflect chemicals and materials in the lab</li>
<li>Facilitate communication between the community, volunteers, operations team, and board as necessary</li>
</ul>
