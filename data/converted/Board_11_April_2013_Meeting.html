<li>Events over the past few months have been good, HackPHX was a good event. Impressed with Treasurer’s clean up of financials. In general impressed with how the lab has been in order, supplies, infrastructure. Volunteers and elected leadership structure is working.</li>
</ul>
<li>Jeremy Leung</li>
<ul>
<li>Been happy to see things like HackPHX, glad to see outreach to the community. The event tested bounds of current location, and have it see peak of use. Lease is ending in about 1 1/2 months. June 1st is renewal time for lease. From the current community, some people mentioned upgrades were needed for the location. Not seeing strong push to look for locations. Have gone with JR to couple locations. Wants to see more of a call from the community if it is actually wanted. Since we only have a month left, have been working with landlord to figure out a way to stay, negotiate a lower rent and a new lease.  Is going to post of up numbers from couple different options to get discussion going of stuff we have to do to stay in location.  Someone has to put in a location package. Prior to that wants to discuss with community. Look closely at the numbers, and discuss if we are going to stay in this location. Do have current numbers for different terms and monthly payments depending on different scenarios. The vote will come up and will have to be brought up at board meeting. Still waiting to hear back from landlord to get more numbers. Wants to have it in before next month and special meeting will have to be called. Urges all board members to look at list of stuff that is discussed before election and look at things community was asking for, and what we want from our positions. Nice to look at accomplishments from previous year.</li>

<li>Chad did great job summarizing. Was working on insurance this month. Large expenditure. Concerned with lack of formal vote. A lot of money spent, but was a necessity so it was paid. Might want to put together budget, instead of spending it in an adhoc fashion.</li>

<li>Not much, one of the initiatives is IT stuff and CTF stuff.  Lucky to have people from outside the community to run CTF stuff.  Lucky to have donations from the community, Honeywell and Will’s former employer.

<p>TO:</p>



<p>Members may bring guests to HSL and guests may use HSL tools, however all parties involved must have completed a liability waiver and all guests must be adequately supervised by the member who brought them.</p>

<h4 id="DISCUSSION_">DISCUSSION:</h4>
<ul>
<li>:::* Nate Caine: End says guest must be supervised. Received negative feedback from trying to enforce supervision of guest.</li>
<li>:::* Will Bradley: Agrees with definition. When someone opens doors then person takes responsibility for guest. Responsibility lays on paid members who lets a guest in. Whoever unlocked the door is responsible for guests even during open hours,</li>
<li>:::* Nate: Rule isn’t enforced.</li>
<li>:::* Will: Reiterates whoever opened the door is responsible for guests even for public hours</li>
<li>:::* Nate: If it is true, then the person who opened the door is responsible for guests</li>
<li>:::* Will: New members are trained on opening procedures and responsibilities.</li>
<li>:::* Tim: Brings wording into what we have been doing, allows guests to use equipment. Descriptive of current state.</li>
<li>:::* Marita: agrees</li>
<li>:::* Will: will further explore issue and enforcement.</li>
<li>:::* Jeremy: if you do have statements then put the issues up on git hub and get more discussion.</li>

<h4 id="DISCUSSION_">DISCUSSION:</h4>
<ul>
<li>:::* Tim: Clarifies that majority of ALL dues paid members have to vote to be removed.</li>
<li>:::* Will: Because bylaws were written when current board members are in, need to allow membership to remove a board members. has to be more than 50% of membership body. Lot of ways board member is unfit, if you anger the rest of the board or 51% of the community then you probably aren’t a good fit.</li>
<li>:::* Brian: asks if there is any legal requirements of wording in bylaws.</li>
<li>:::* Jeremy: Is in requirements of state laws, so would be redundant.</li>

<li>:::* Marita: Doesn’t feel like harassment is defined.</li>
<li>:::* Will: Just to re-emphasize rules</li>
<li>:::* Chad: Feels like we shouldn’t give advice on how to act, why isn’t it somewhere else?</li>
