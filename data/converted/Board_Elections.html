<h1>Board Elections</h1>
<p>=Necessity for a Board= Now that we've incorporated, been granted our 501c3, and grown into our own permanent location we have the tools and community to be able to do great things.  We'll need a team of people who have focused responsibilities that will aid in keeping HeatSync Labs in working order.  Check out the information under "Board Meeting" for when Board Meetings happen to get a feel for that structure.</p>

<h2 id="Positions">Positions</h2>
<p>There is much written about how large a board should be.  Some non profits will seek to have large boards which are meant to represent many different interests and donors in the community.  Other advice argues to keep a board small and agile.  For now it is expected our board will be small, agile, and targeted to the task at hand, creating a hackerspace out of nothing.  As such these positions were chosen to represent what we should need now.</p>
