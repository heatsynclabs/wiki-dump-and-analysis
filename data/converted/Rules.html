<p>More than anything else, membership is a regular donation. Its is NOT payment for a service.</p>

<p><strong>Teachers get 50% off any membership.</strong> Sign up as normal, just make your payments for the discount rate.</p>

<h3 id="Membership_Fees">Membership Fees</h3>
<p>If you sign up for membership via PayPal, your recurring monthly dues will be subtracted from your account the same date you enrolled. If you chose Cash/Check -- you can either mail your dues (108 West Main St. Mesa, AZ 85201) or deliver it to the current treasurer (treasurer @ heatsynclabs.org) at HeatSync. Please note recurring payments are -highly- encouraged-- remember we do not have staff. If cash/check are important please consider using your bank's automatic bill-pay feature, or prepaying for 3, 6 or 12 months up front.  <strong>Note:</strong> Membership fees are nonrefundable.</p>

<h3 id="Membership_and_Equipment">Membership and Equipment</h3>

<p>The equipment in the lab, and the supplies necessary to keep equipment in operation, are the responsibility of the members of Heatsync Labs. Supplies, materials, and other consumables, are kept in stock to the extent that members purchase them for the lab.</p>

<p>Consumables such as stock, drill/mill bits, adhesives,etc are NOT a right of membership.  Many consumables are available in the shop but are expected to be refilled by members, or not be available.  Spare stock from projects may be stored in the space and is encouraged to be used--and refilled.</p>

<h3 id="Good_Standing">Good Standing</h3>
<p>A member shall be considered in good standing if they are current on their dues or on a current board-approved scholarship.</p>

<p>If a member fails to pay their dues in a given month, HSL will make a good faith effort to contact them for resolution.</p>

<p>If the member refuses to pay their dues, membership will be immediately terminated. If they have a storage box/locker, they will be given 30 days to claim its contents, after which the contents will be donated to charity.</p>

<p>If the member is unreachable and/or does not respond to HSL's contact efforts within 60 days, a second contact will be attempted. If they are still unreachable and/or unresponsive after an additional 30 days, the contents of their storage box/locker will be donated to charity.</p>

<h3 id="CNC_Mill">CNC Mill</h3>
<p><strong>See <a href="CNC_Mill.html">CNC Mill</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>HeatSync Training, or other formal training plus a basic HSL "test-out", required for use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mill rules apply to CNC Mill</li>
<li>Do not leave the mill unattended. Stay within reach of the emergency stop button at all times while running.</li>
<li>Preview all milling jobs before running on the machine.</li>
<li>DO NOT hand-edit your G-code programs.</li>
<li>TODO: Add more safety & maintenance rules</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Getting_Started_Resources">Getting Started Resources</h4>
<p>If you'd like to use the CNC Mill, we are still working on a class but we have identified some things you'll need to learn first. So, you can get started right now on your own! <strong>Keep in mind these are intended as e-learning preparation for an eventual class, not as a substitute for hands-on training.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Multiple hours of Mill and 3D printer experience will be invaluable if not mandatory, because all the "gotchas" of both machines are present in a CNC Mill.</li>
<li>Ability to read G-code and M-code. The codes scroll by as the mill runs your program, and if there's any problem you'll need to have a basic understanding in order to troubleshoot things. There's only a couple dozen, so it's not too hard.</li>
<li>* Some starter resources I found while googling:</li>

<li>** http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=CNC+Basics+E-Course</li>
<li>** http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cnc+g-code</li>
<li>Try using CAD/CAM programs like Solidworks with HSMXpress, or other CAD programs with CamBam, to design a part and generate GCode for it.</li>

<li>** http://www.instructables.com/id/From-SketchUp-to-CNC-Fabrication/</li>
<li>Try using Mach3 - it's the program that directly controls the CNC machine based on the GCode you've made - free trial from here: http://www.machsupport.com/</li>

<li>Utilize the air filter, if available, on your iron to protect you from solder/flux fumes or only solder in well ventilated rooms</li>
