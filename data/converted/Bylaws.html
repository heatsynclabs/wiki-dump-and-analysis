The Quarterly Scholarship may only be issued to the same person once in a 3-month period and must be awarded by a majority vote of the Board of Directors.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="_li_CARD_ACCESS__li_"><li>CARD ACCESS</li></h2>

<p>Having card access to the lab is both a privilege and a responsibility.  Card access is a privilege based on trust, not a "right" of membership.  Having card access means that the individual understands and respects the rules of the lab and is willing to conform to said rules.</p>

<p>For example, introduce yourself during open hours, help out during HYH, make friends, make things, ask for proposals that benefit the lab, provide constructive feedback on other's proposals. If you can't come in during open hours, make friends online and ask for favors. It's tough but we're a community not a business.</p>

<h3 id="Eligibility">Eligibility</h3>
<p>Must be a paying member at the $50 or higher level, in good standing, for a minimum of two (2) months Must attend HYH, or during public hours, so the community can be introduced to the individual</p>

<h3 id="Nomination___Proposal">Nomination / Proposal</h3>
<p>Any current card member can nominate a non-card member once the non-card member meets the eligibility criteria. Proposal for card access is posted publicly via Google Groups (subject prefix "Proposal: Card Access for xxx") at least 2 weeks prior to the HYH meeting. The member making the proposal *must* be present at the HYH to introduce the non-card member (if necessary) and to answer any additional questions that might come up. The member making the proposal will be a mentor/responsible for the non-card member for a 6-month probationary period. Members may only make “one” card access nomination per year. Example: If Member A nominates someone, whether it passes or not, Member A may not nominate another person for 12 months.</p>

<h3 id="Approval">Approval</h3>
<p>Card access can only be voted on by card members. There must be at least 5 card members present to vote. Members can receive cards when approved by a majority vote of card members at an operations meeting ("Hack your Hackerspace" night).</p>

<h3 id="Revocation">Revocation</h3>
<p>Card access may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors. Card access is immediately terminated if the member cancels their membership or lowers their membership to a non-eligible level. Card access may be removed due to code of conduct violation.</p>

<h2 id="PROPOSAL_PROCESS">PROPOSAL PROCESS</h2>

<p>Based on Current Practices and Robert’s Rules of Order</p>

<p>HeatSync Labs has a proposal process so that changes to the space are made thoughtfully and with input from the community. It gives members a way to suggest ideas, discuss them openly, and make sure they are practical before being put to a vote. This helps avoid rushed decisions, keeps things fair, and ensures that proposals are realistic and beneficial. It’s a simple way to make sure everyone has a say in how HeatSync Labs evolves.</p>

<h3 id="Proposal_Submission">Proposal Submission</h3>

<ul>
<li>The individual submitting the proposal must be its owner and responsible party. Proposals may not be submitted on behalf of another person unless they explicitly agree to take ownership of the proposal and its implementation.</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="Proposal_Discussion_and_Refinement__9-Day_Discussion_Period__Lock-In_Rule_">Proposal Discussion and Refinement (9-Day Discussion Period, Lock-In Rule)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Members provide public feedback in the Google Group before the HYH meeting.</li>
<li>Proposals should be discussed in depth, and members are encouraged to provide substantive feedback rather than just “+1” or “I agree.”</li>
<li>The proposer may adjust the proposal based on discussion, but:</li>
<li>No further changes may be made within one week of the HYH meeting.</li>
<li>The final version of the proposal must be clearly posted and locked in the Google Group at least one week before the meeting.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="Proposal_Consideration_at_HYH_Meeting">Proposal Consideration at HYH Meeting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Proposals are automatically considered at the HYH meeting if they have been discussed for 9 days.</li>
<li>The proposer actively bumps the proposal in Google Groups so members are reminded that the proposal is up for a vote.</li>
<li>The proposer (or a designated representative) must add it to the agenda, and verbally introduce the proposal during the meeting.</li>
<li>If a proposer fails to mention or remind the group about the proposal, it will not be eligible for a vote and must be deferred to the next HYH meeting.</li>
<li>The proposer must provide a brief summary before the vote.</li>
<li>If a quorum is not present (minimum 8 paying/scholarship members), the vote may be skipped or delayed until later in the meeting or deferred to the next HYH meeting.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Voting_Process">Voting Process</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only paying/scholarship members in good standing are eligible to vote on proposals.</li>
<li>A proposal passes with a majority vote of those voting (abstentions do not count toward the total).</li>
<ul>
<li>Example: If 2 vote yes, 1 votes no, and 5 abstain, the vote passes (2-1).</li>
</ul>
<li>A quorum requires at least 8 paying/scholarship members present, but only votes cast count toward the outcome.</li>
<li>Ties result in no action, and the proposal does not pass, and may be resubmitted following the resubmission restrictions.</li>
<li>Votes are conducted via show of hands or another predetermined method at the meeting.</li>
<li>Voting results must be posted to HeatSync Labs’ Google Group within seven (7) days of the meeting to ensure transparency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Resubmission_Restrictions__Preventing_Stacking_of_Votes_">Resubmission Restrictions (Preventing Stacking of Votes)</h3>

<p>If a proposal fails, it cannot be resubmitted for six (6) months, unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposer makes substantial changes, and the members present at an HYH meeting vote to allow early reconsideration.</li>
<li>To be eligible for early reconsideration, the proposer must clearly outline the new information or significant changes before members vote on whether it should return to the agenda.</li>
<li>Vote for reconsideration can be made 4 weeks after reconsideration request is made.</li>
<li>Substantial Change Examples:</li>
<ul>
<li>✅ A significant reduction or expansion in scope, addressing major concerns.</li>
<li>✅ Securing external funding that eliminates previous financial concerns.</li>
<li>❌ Minor wording tweaks or slight budget reallocations do not qualify.</li>
</ul>
<li>The discussion on whether a proposal qualifies for reconsideration should take place as part of an HYH meeting agenda item.</li>
<li>A similar proposal that only modifies minor details will be treated as a duplicate and will not be placed on the agenda until the six-month restriction expires.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Implementation_and_Follow-Up">Implementation and Follow-Up</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="Quick_Proposal_Self-Check_Before_Submitting">Quick Proposal Self-Check Before Submitting</h3>

<p>When submitting a proposal, it’s important to think beyond the initial idea and consider its long-term impact on HeatSync Labs. Below are key factors that can help refine your proposal and ensure a smoother approval process.</p>

<h4 id="Building_Impact">Building Impact</h4>

<ul>
<li>Electrical – Will this require new wiring, outlets, or increased power usage?</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="Usage_Considerations">Usage Considerations</h4>

<ul>
<li>Cleaning – Does this introduce new cleaning responsibilities? Who is responsible?</li>
<li>Training – Will members need special training to use the equipment safely?</li>
<li>Classes & Workshops – Could this be integrated into educational offerings for the community?</li>
<li>Lifetime – Is this a long-term addition, or does it have a defined end-of-use period?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="CODE_OF_CONDUCT">CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
<p>Summary- I shall (i) use HeatSync Labs with the purpose to provide a physical space for members and the public to work on projects (especially projects involving physical creation) and to facilitate relevant education, discussion, collaboration, and planning; (ii) take good care of the premises and keep it clean and orderly; (iii) not waste electricity or other resources; (iv) agree and warrant that if at any time I believe conditions to be unsafe, I will immediately discontinue further participation in the activity whether by myself or others; (v) be excellent to each other; and (v) I will report misconduct to the board of directors at <a href="mailto:conduct@heatsynclabs.org" rel="nofollow">conduct@heatsynclabs.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is aspirational in nature.  The big idea is to treat others and all tools in the space the same way that you treat someone you care about.</p>

<p>A big part of HeatSync Labs mission of making tools accessible is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, race, national origin or ancestry, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We expect all those who participate in HeatSync Labs to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="Open__Source_Culture_Tech__Citizenship">Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h3>
<p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [Source/Culture/Tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.</p>
