If purchasing a phone number from Twilio/Tropo, configure the number to robo-voice rick roll them when they return their call.\n\nThe asterisk and pound keys aren't used for anything in this, so they can be ignored or programmed to display \"loldongs\" or other meme references.\n\n==Sauce==\nSource code is available at [https://github.com/huertanix/loldialer the loldialer Github repo].\nSource code that supports the Adafruit membrane keypad, Tropo, and Nyan cat is in the [https://github.com/huertanix/loldialer/tree/adafruit Adafruit branch].\n\n==BONUS==\nTwilio can do transcription, so it would be cool to record what the user says when they get trolled and display it on the LCD.  9001% of the time it will probably look like this:\n\n<blockquote>\nHello\n<br />\nWhat the frack\n<br />\nFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-\n</blockquote>\n\n...and that will never get old.\n\n==Truly Evil Mad Scientist BONUS==\nRandomly generate a phone number that isn't part of an emergency service or public utility on Friday at midnight and Fridayroll it.\n\n--[[User:Huertanix|Huertanix]] 19:59, 7 November 2010 (UTC)",
