Will need to be updated.\n\n# Locate water spray bottle\n# Locate fire extinguisher\n# Most flare-ups will self-extinguish when the laser stops\n# Stay at the laser while it is running. If you must leave, someone else trained must take your place.\n# If you need to suspend your job quickly, raise the hood. Cutting will resume when you lower the hood.\n\n\n[[Category:Laser]]\n[[Category:High Priority]]",
