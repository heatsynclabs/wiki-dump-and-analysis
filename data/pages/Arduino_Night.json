    "text": "Arduino Night is a time honored tradition that was originally started by another group at Gangplank and soon thereafter, adopted by [[HeatSync Labs]]. [[HeatSync Labs]] opens the door to welcome members of the community at large to share knowledge and ideas on the Arduino microcontroller. Check the [http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/ Event Calendar] for upcoming Arduino nights.\n\nAll skill levels are welcome. Bring your own or use one of Arduino setups on-site. Tutorials are provided for beginners and more complex sensors and devices are available for intermediate and expert levels.\n\n== Arduino Models Available==\nHere are the current Arduino models that we have available to play with at the lab:\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n[[File:arduino.jpg]] \n</div>\n* Arduino Diecimila x1\n* Lilypad Arduino x1\n* Arduino Uno x1\n* Arduino Duemilanove (\"2009\") x2\n* Arduino Mega x1\n* Funnel IO with ATmega168 x1\n<div style=\"clear: both\"> </div>\n\n== Arduino Shields ==\n\n* Ethernet Shield v.1.1  -  Older version of this.

We're looking for volunteers on our first Wednesdays to help answer questions and give direction to people just starting out with Arduino.  Also, people that are interested in helping host this event and have any suggestions to improve it:\n\n* Your Name Here!\n\n== Donations ==\n\nCan't come by and volunteer some time but you still want to help out some how?  We're always looking to expand our available selection of components, sensors, arduinos, etc. to play with.  Donations can be dropped off in our lab with a note stating:  \"Attention: Arduino Night\"\n\n== Suggestions For Content and Improvement ==\n\nTo ensure that we keep pushing this event forward we're always open for suggestions for improving the structure and the way we present the material for these nights.  Also, any suggestions for new components and tools are welcome:\n\n*Label the Components, Sensors, Motors, etc. with what they are.\n*Suggested Pre-Requisite Reading?\n*A cheat-sheet for commands/function names/overall sketch flow?\n*Focus on interacting with a single component for a session.  Getting really good at that one thing and then moving on to something else next class.\n*Provide each station with a \"grab bag\" project that already has hardware to get new users used to the tool.\n\n== Helpful Links ==\n\nMain Arduino Project Page:<br>\nhttp://www.arduino.cc/\n\nGreat Arduino Tutorial by Lady Ada:<br>\nhttp://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/index.html\n\n[[Category:Events]]",
