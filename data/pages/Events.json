Events should support our non-profit educational mission.\n\n'''To host an event'''\n* Check the calendar on our home page for a time when there are no conflicting events.\n* Fill out the [https://forms.gle/74kL9RutY2e3WDtZA Event Scheduling Request form].\n* You'll get a respond with any questions or a message the calendar has been updated.\n\n== Guidelines on Ticket Prices ==\n\nOur current policy is the following: Ticket prices are set by the instructor. 30% of profits goes to HeatSync Labs 70% to instructors.\n* Instructors may offer a discount ticket price for members\n* Instructor amount = (total ticket sales - materials costs) * 70%\n* HeatSync Labs amount = (Total ticket sales - materials cost) * 30%\n\n== Guidelines On \"Certification\" Workshops ==\nCertification workshops are those which are used to train membership on usage of some of our more dangerous/expensive tools. The tools which require certification to use are chosen by the tools' station heads.\n\n* Whenever a \"certification\" workshop is presented it shall be presented as such.\n* The Instructor agrees to present the workshop according to the guidelines provided by HeatSync Labs.\n\nInstructor Eligibility: \n* One must be a member in good standing with HeatSync Labs\n* One must be already certified on the tools before you are authorized to teach\n\n= Presentations =\nHeatSync Labs is always looking for more presentations to host at our monthly meetings.  What would you like to hear about and what knowledge can you impart to the rest of us? The following list is a record of past presenters and presentations topics.  We hope to upload presentation slides/videos in the future. Also, feel free to request a presentation on a topic you are interested in; chances are someone may in a group may know something about it. You can also request a repeat of a previous presentation. \n\n===Presentation Suggestions for the Future===\nIf you have something you'd like to see, please add it in a bullet here. Maybe tie in a monthly theme regarding a particular item or technique (i.e. casting, milling, or spinning) and include a monthly demo. Try to focus on fundamental materials or methods to build on previously covered topics.\n\n*Human Powered Vehicles\n*Remote-LAN Microcontroller HAX with Arduino\n\n=== Future Presentations ===\n* [[Presentations/DMS|Developing Maintainable Software]]\n\n== Past Events ==\n[https://groups.google.com/g/heatsynclabs/c/zS3v8zAV5fQ/m/sbzW0sxWBgAJ Group post of all events prior to 2017]\n\n*[[HotTopics]]\n*[[Laser_Mustache_Party|One Year Anniversary Party]]\n*[[First Friday]]\n*[[Makerfaire]]\n*[[Physical_Data_Recovery]]\n*Arduino and VOIP - [[Dial-a-Lulz]]\n*Astronomy\n*Eagle PCB Layout and Design\n*PCB Chemical Etching,Heat Transfer, with FeCl\n*[http://code.google.com/p/haptic-research-group/ Haptic Belt ]\n*[http://toool.us/membership.html Lock Picking]\n*[http://cube.ly Cube.ly 3D printing design]\n*PaperCraft\n*Thermoforming\n*Idaho Near Space Project [http://nebarnix.com/heatsync.pptx Balloon Communications Payload]\n*High Speed Photography -- or \"shooting things\"\n*Haystack Project\n*Working with acrylic\n*Hacking Glass\n*Rep Rap made easy\n*Teardown party-everyone brings something to tear apart\n*Lathing for fun and profit\n*EL Wire\n*Monster party-everyone brings plushie and we tear them up to be reassembled--also do some actuators, lights, sound things for people to add in(programmable greeting card sounds, 555 timer leds)\n*Coffee Science and Arduino\n*CAD/CAM\n*Intel Meego App Up\n*Electron Microscopy\n*Arissat 1 - an amateur satellite launched from the International Space Station\n*Building a Scanning Electron Microscope\n*Knitting, Soldering, and Origami for Japan\n*Food Science / Molecular Gastronomy\n*FIRST Robotics\n*[http://www.kzell.com/ KZell Metal Fabrication Tour]\n*Leatherworking\n*Retro Gaming\n*Electronic Music\n\n== See Also ==\n*[[Fundraising]]\n\n[[Category:Events]]",
