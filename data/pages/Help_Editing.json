A special function known as [[protection]] can be applied to a page by [[administrator]]s, making the said page uneditable to certain classes of users. There are several degrees of protection: \n*If a page is semiprotected, it can be edited by everyone except IPs and accounts that have not yet been [[autoconfirmation|confirmed]].\n*If a page is fully protected, only other admins can make edits to the page.\n*A page can also be protected so that it cannot be [[move|moved]].\n*In some cases, an admin might see fit to protect a page from being created.\n*For very rare pages, such as the Main Page, \"cascading\" protection is applied, wherein every page that is [[transcluded]] onto a page is protected too. \nThere are various reasons why a page might be protected. Vandalism and spam can lead to semiprotection, while content wars and other severe cases can lead to full protection. There are other times where [[Office actions]] come into play. For the most part, protection is temporary and editing privileges are then restored. In any case, everyone can [[view source|view the source]] of any page, irrespective of its level of protection.",
