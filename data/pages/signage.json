    "text": "==Overview==\nWe have a lot of signs around the lab to help people understand what things are about.\n\nThis page will document the signage and where available links will be added to the original files in case updates are needed later.\n\nDarrell has added QR Codes on many of the tools in the lab linking the user manual. Many tools will require additional and more specific safety precautions not outlined on other signage in the lab.\n\nWhen creating new signs in the lab it may be helpful to consider the [[Press_Kit#Logo_Pack_.26_Brand_Standards | brand standards]].\n\nMany of the donation bins were made by David Flores and the front panels can be removed and updated.\n\n==General Signage==\n*Password for the WiFi, on all the co-working monitors and above front doors in green vinyl.\n*Most of the stations have an orange tile with the name of the station made with black vinyl.\n*On some tools Training Required stickers read: \"Notification HeatSync Labs Training Required\".\n*[[File:No_Trespassing_Sign.zip]] We may need a this in Spanish also.\n*[[Parking_Permit | Parking Permits]] and [[Parking_Ticket | Parking Tickets]] are used for tagging non-lab owned stuff in the lab.\n\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:General_No_Trespassing.jpg\nFile:General_Do_Not_Enter_Stairs.jpg\nFile:General_Emergency_Contact.jpg | Info on this sign is outdated.\nFile:General_Flier_Front.jpg\nFile:General_Flier_Back.jpg\nFile:General_Hand_Tools_Sign.jpg\nFile:General_How_To_Use_Calipers.jpg\nFile:General_Push_Bar_To_Open.jpg | The lettering is retro-reflective vinyl.\nFile:General_Sandwhich_Board_Sign.jpg | Fits 11 x 17 printed poster.\nFile:General_Snacks_Donate.jpg\nFile:General_Donation_Bin.jpg | By the front doors.\nFile:General_Keychain_Dispenser.jpg | The tall donation bin between electronics and the woodworking tools area.\nFile:General_Collect_Your_Stuff_Shelf.png\nFile:General_Parking_Permits.png\n</gallery>\n\n==[[3D_Printers | 3d Printer Station]]==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:3d_Printing_QR_Code.jpg\nFile:3d_Printing_Guidelines.jpg\nFile:3d_Printing_Donation_Box.jpg\nFile:3d_Printing_BYOF.jpg\nFile:3d_Printing_Completed_Parts_Bin.jpg\nFile:3d_Printing_Wash_Station.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==[[Arts and Crafts]]==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Art_Station_Donation_Bin.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==[[Bicycle_Repair_Station | Bike Sync Labs]]==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Bicycle_Station_Sign.jpg\nFile:Bicycle_Vinyl_Decal.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==[[Laser_Cutters | Laser Station]]==\n\n*[[File:Laser_Scrap_Sign_F.zip | Laser Scrap Signage]]\n*User Drive: access tip on top of 60 W laser monitor.\n**There is a User drive where you can create a folder with your name to store your files.\n**To access this with LaserCut 5.3 type \"\\\\Files\\Users\" into the file open dialogue box.\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Laser_Training_Required.jpg\nFile:Laser_Machine_has_no_Brain.jpg\nFile:Laser_Donation_Box.jpg\nFile:Laser_QR_Code_for_Manual.jpg\nFile:Laser_Do_Not_Operate_Unattended.jpg\nFile:Laser_Scap_Sign.png|laser scrap sign\n</gallery>\n\n==[[Machine Shop]]==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Machining_Yellow_Door_Sign.jpg\nFile:Machining_White_Door_Sign.jpg\nFile:Machining_Breaker_Sign.jpg\nFile:Machining_Breaker_CautIon_Tape.jpg\nFile:Machining_Welding_Wall_Sign.jpg\nFile:Machining_Starret_Tap_Drill_Sizes.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==[[Electronics | Electronics and Microcontrollers]]==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Microcontroller_Donation_Box.jpg\nFile:Electronics_Microcontroller_Sign.png\nFile:Electronics_Soldering_Sign.png\nFile:Electronics_Donation_Box.png\nFile:Electronics_Soldering_Sign_2.png\nFile:Electronics_Soldering_Instructions.png\n</gallery>\n\n==[[Sewing]]==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Sewing_Machine_Certification.jpg\nFile:Sewing_Hackerspace_Rulez.jpg\nFile:Sewing_Light_Switch.jpg\nFile:Sewing_Certified_Users.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==[[Welding]]==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Welding_Back_Door_Warnings.jpg\nFile:Welding_Turn_Off_Gas_By_Tanks.jpg\nFile:Welding_Turn_off_Gas_Door_Sign.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Window==\n<gallery widths==947px heights==40px>\nFile:Window_Poster_Left.jpg\nFile:Window_Poster_Right.jpg | [[File:hsl_flier_1.pdf]]\nFile:Window_Entrance_Sign_At_108.jpg\nFile:Window_Jewelry_Display.jpg\nFile:Window_We_Don't_Sell_Things.jpg\nFile:Window_Wooden_Gear_Sign.jpg\n</gallery>",
