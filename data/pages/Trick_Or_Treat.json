    "text": "Around Halloween the DMA plans a trick or treat event involving the local shops. It's way too much traffic to give people tours inside the building. The last 2 years we gave away stickers and told people about HeatSync Labs plus promoted any upcoming events.\n\nFor 2023 we gave out ghost stickers (leftover from 2022) as well as pumpkin and jack-o-lantern faces. People were able to put the faces on their pumpkin to customize it. Beau did all the cutting for pumpkins and jack-o-lanterns. I (Eric) got the artwork together though it's just from standard clip art so won't be shared here on the wiki.\n\nWe had Eric Mattie, Jon, Beau and Arnob helping. Eric talked really loudly at the crowds telling them about HeatSync Labs and events coming up. Mattie had kids choosing their stickers. Jon, and Arnob provided tours of the lab. Some rotation happened so nobody was out in the chaos the entire time.\n\n==Ideas for next time==\nPlan ahead and cut the stickers in advance. Anyone wanting to learn to use the vinyl cutter could be given the chance to help out cutting them.\n\nOr just hand out candy. This will move people faster and it may be tricky to tell people much as they move through. Still an option to consider.\n\nPrint posters listing upcoming events. Sadly the printer wasn't working so that didn't get done this time.\n\nWe could probably cut the vinyl horizontally between rows to weed faster.\n\nWe could make stamp the back of the stickers with HeatSyncLabs.org and maybe something else upcoming.\n\n\n[[Category:Events]]",
