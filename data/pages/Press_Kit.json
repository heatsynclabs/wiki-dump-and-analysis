    "text": "Thank you for your interest!\n\nSee below for a press-ready description of HeatSync.\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\nEstablished in 2009, HeatSync Labs is Arizona's first 501(c)3 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace hackerspace]. We are a community workshop that makes workspace, tools, and other resources available to students and hobbyists, artists, engineers and entrepreneurs to build their projects, prototypes, and art. We believe in creating a community of collaboration and learning-by-doing.\n\n'''Please remember:''' the proper spelling/capitalization is '''HeatSync Labs''' or simply '''HeatSync''', and our preferred pronouns are ''hackerspace, makerspace, workshop, or community''. It may be tempting or convenient to call us an incubator, coworking space, or hangout, and those things might happen at HeatSync, but that isn't our purpose or focus and so using those words detracts from the physical creation and invention that is our core purpose.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe concept for HeatSync Labs came out of the desire for a group of Arizona locals to get together and continue working on projects after academic life. Instead of working alone, we wanted to build our workshops in public. Throughout 2009, we discovered, and in some cases, visited, other notable 'hackerspaces' popping up across the country ([https://noisebridge.net/ NoiseBridge], [http://pumpingstationone.org/ Pumping Station: One], [https://www.nycresistor.com/ NYC Resistor], [https://hacklab.to/ Hacklab Toronto], and [http://hacdc.org/ HacDC]) and wondered what was holding us back.  We decided to join in on the fun.\n\nWe started our meetings in 2009 at the Mesa Fraternal Order of Police lodge, sans wifi or permanent space, then moving to Chandler's Gangplank in January 2010, and as of June 2011 began renting our own facility in Downtown Mesa. What started out as a few excited people in a police lodge meeting biweekly is now a community of hundreds, with over fourty paying members occupying our location nearly 24/7.\n\n== Logo Pack & Brand Standards ==\n\nDownload the logo pack, including the branding guidelines for proper use here\n[[File:Heatsync labs logo pack.zip]]\n\nFor '''just''' our brand standards, see: [[File:Heatsync_labs_brand_standards.pdf]]\n\n\n== Flier / Poster ==\n\nPromote HeatSync with this snazzy flier: [[File:hsl_flier_1.pdf]]\n\n== CNC Ready Vector ==\n\nVector File Ready for the laser or vinyl cutter: [[File:HeattSync_Logo_Simplified_SVG.zip]]\n\n*(See logo pack above for full color vector versions)\n\n----\n\n== Selected bitmaps (see logo pack for vectors) ==\n\n[[File:Heatsync labs icon - color - latest.png|360x360px]]\n\n[[File:Heatsync labs icon - black - latest.png]]\n\n[[File:Heatsync labs logo - color - latest.png|950x230px]]\n\n[[File:Heatsync labs logo - black - latest.png]]\n\n= QR Codes =\n\n== Website Front Page ==\n\n[[File:hsl_website_qr_code.png|200x200px]]\n\n= Fonts =\n\n== Logo Font (GPL) ==\n\n[[File:charis_sil.zip]]\n\n= Colors =\n'''HSL Orange:''' \n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 1rem;\">\n<pre style=\"background-color: #F99B0C; width: 50px; height: 50px; display: inline-block; border: none;\"></pre>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;\">\n<div><strong>RGB</strong>: <span style=\"font-family: monospace, monospace;\">249 155 12</span></div>\n<div><strong>HEX</strong>: <span style=\"font-family: monospace, monospace;\">#F99B0C</span></div>\n<div><strong>CMYK</strong>: <span style=\"font-family: monospace, monospace;\">0 38 95 2</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n'''HSL Black'''\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 1rem;\">\n<pre style=\"background-color: #2c2c29; width: 50px; height: 50px; display: inline-block; border: none;\"></pre>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;\">\n<div><strong>RGB</strong>: <span style=\"font-family: monospace, monospace;\">44 44 41</span></div>\n<div><strong>HEX</strong>: <span style=\"font-family: monospace, monospace;\">#2C2C29</span></div>\n<div><strong>CMYK</strong>: <span style=\"font-family: monospace, monospace;\">0 0 7 83</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n= Business Card =\n\nLayout is for 3.5\" x 2\" with .125 bleed.
