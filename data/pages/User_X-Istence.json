    "text": "== Who Am I? ==\n\nI am Bert JW Regeer, I am a Software Engineering student at UAT, and I dabble in electronics to solve problems I have or try to find cool projects to work on. I have been actively involved in many aspects of UAT, working on many different projects with many of the HeatSyncLabs crew and friends from UAT. I am from The Netherlands, and have lived in three different countries and travelled the world. I tend to be closed off and keep to myself unless it is a topic I am very enthusiastic about.\n\nDo not try to get information out of me without doing research, I will tell you to go to [http://google.com/ Google]. Everything I know I learned by wanting to know more, doing research, trying it out and logical deduction. People who want to leech of other people to get information are the worst kind of people in my book, they will expect to be spoon fed information until they die.\n\n== Portfolio ==\n\nCheck out my  [http://bertjwregeer.com/ personal porfolio website].\n\n== Contact ==\n\nFeel free to contact me by emailing me at bertjw [at] regeer [dot] org.",
