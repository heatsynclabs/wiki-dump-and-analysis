Pretty rare, but if it does you can push the belt back down. You will want to check that you can get full travel. The part where the belt ends are clamped can bump into the rollers. Adjust the left and right position until you can move it fully left and right without it binding on the rollers.\n\n== Silhouette Cameo ==\nThis uses the Silhouette Studio software and the sticky mats to hold your material.\nPlenty of material online on usage.\n\n\n== Heat Press ==\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043H9FMU/ Fancierstudio Heat press] 15x15 inch digital\n\n[[Category:Vinyl]]",
