    "text": "\"Non-profit, as well as government agency business plans tend to focus on the \"organizational mission\" which is the basis for their governmental status or their non-profit, tax-exempt status, respectively.\" - Wikipedia\n\n=Executive Summary(We write this last)=\n*Quick elevator\n*quick summary of accomplishments\n*quick explanation of our needs (the move)\n\n=Business Description=\nHeatSync Labs provides a collaborative workspace where engineers, entrepreneurs, students and tinkerers come together to imagine and build tomorrow’s innovations.\n \nWe break down barriers to innovation by providing equipment and facilities to people interested in programming, hardware hacking, physics, chemistry, mathematics, photography, security, robotics, and art. \n \nWe encourage hands-on development of exciting new creations, we host talks, workshops, and encourage knowledge exchange through collaborative development projects, and we stimulate learning by providing mentoring and cross-disciplinary educational opportunities.\n\nOur vision is a world where we re-awaken our population and reinstate the knowledge of creation in opposition to our throw-away society. We aim to empower our population, delivering the confidence and skills to compete in a globalized economy.\n\n=Industry Overview=\n\nWe are part of a larger maker/do-it-yourself culture exemplified by everything from other hackerspaces to DIY home and garden television to Oreilly's popular Make Magazine. Hackerspaces are the places on the ground where this spirit is incubated throughout the year, not just monthly or yearly during publication.  These spaces popping are up throughout the United States, and globally, all with different visions and goals, but all listing themselves at hackerspaces.org. XXX new spaces per year, XXX per state at this point. TechShop is perhaps the most interesting and applicable of these spaces.  They do a lot of what we do, albeit in the for profit realm.  In March they opened their new location in San Francisco, their third, and are adding San Jose in the next few months while planning New York and Detroit and Texas next.  Make Magazine, part of the Oreilly publishing arm, are perhaps one of the most surprising tales in this DIY industry.  In a somewhat floundering publishing market they have increased their distribution from 60,000 with their first issue in 2005 to over 300,000 this year. They also have found success running a science fair/convention based around their magazine called Maker Faire.  Started in 2006 in San Mateo with 22,000 attendees they have nearly doubled attendance each year to 160,000 attendees in 2010. They've since begun branching out with full Faires in New York and Detroit and are feeling out new markets with their \"Mini Maker Faire\" held all around the world including North Carolina, Vancouver, and the United Kingdom. The online DIY protyping services are another good indicator of our market.  These services provide parts to create or enclosure your creation.  Sparkfun, founded in 2003, now has over 80 employees, have created their 1 millionth widget, and are over 10million in revenue this year.  Similar services from Adafruit, MakerShed, Parallax and LiquidWare are all over 1 million in revenue this year.\n\n=Competitive Analysis(analyze direct and indirect competitors=\n===Universities and Tech Schools===\nHigh schools are pulling out of access to the tools of creation because of safety, budget cuts, etc. Colleges continue to be silos. Inter-departmental bickering and inability to communicate leads to an institution with all the tools present which are necessary to succeed, yet frustratingly kept at arms length. They build large buildings off campus offering offices and even more closed off spaces. All offer course ware focused on electrical/mechanical engineering and arts, however, cost thousands of dollars and several years to gain access to equipment and get the applied learning. With the amount of people in these programs it is often the case that even if you are in the program at the institution you have to wait in a very long queue of peers to gain access to equipment. Access may be granted past project deadlines and alternatives are needed. Local titans include ASU, U of A, MCC and EVIT.\n\n===Incubators/Accelerators===\nIncubators benefit in being able to direct entrepreneurs down the path of starting their own business as well as helping them find the investors needed to kickstart their ideas. However, putting on tech talks and having free food doesn't build a community, it simply attracts an audience that prefers to be fed--literally and metaphorically. On top of that most incubators end up being extensions of the silos that universities are already creating with separation between different disciplines. More recently Accelerators have become vogue.  They tend to take the 'academic' out of 'incubator'.  The players here locally include Skysong's Hackspace, Innovations Chandler, and recently AZ Disruptors.  Nationally Techstars and 500 Startups have made a name for themselves.\n\n===Co-Working/Collaboration===\nCo-working locations tend to provide collaborative spaces where startups and individuals can save on office space costs by sharing. Many offer an area for the general public to work creating a community of like minded individuals or partners for projects and business. Many locations currently focus on computer programming, design, or marketing companies that only require desk space. Recently the line between co-working, incubators and accelerators are blurring. Local spaces that self-identify in this area include Gangplank and Co-Hoots.\n\n\nWhat makes us different from all these is our focus on infrastructure.  Even our schools are pulling out of this area in frustration. It has become very vogue to open a space, provide wifi and try to build community around bring-your-own-computer concepts. These purposely dodge the challenges of infrastructure where we refuse to back down. The infrastructure is indeed the hard part, but it is also the difference. The infrastructure safety, training, liability, skills and experience are the key to bringing creation back to our throw away society.\n\n=Market Analysis(target market)=\nWe define our 'market' rather broadly as our mission is nonprofit and educational in nature. In short we want to collect entrepreneurs, creatives, professionals, hobbysits and students together under one roof. Age, gender, ethnicity, etc are of no importance to us. \n\n==Students==\nOn campuses, technical students are becoming more and more disenfranchised with the opportunities and equipment available to them in academia. There was a day many years ago where the only place you could find a 'computer' was in academia, but that time has passed. There may be as many as 300,000 college and technical school students in the phoenix metro area, with only maybe 5% with arts/ design/technical backgrounds, leading to 15,000 possible customers. These customers are going to be more eager to get their hands on professional equipment, but also more sensitive to price. It will be important to stress the experience and connections membership in our elite organization can bring them, connections to local jobs and internships, as well as a start upon the career of an entrepreneur. A specific group to target are the First Robotics Groups within schools as these students are already working on interdisciplinary engineering and could utilize our resources. Students and hobbyists want to be a part of something big. They want to bump into big thinkers working on big projects and be invited to help and learn. Hopefully they want to become entrepreneurs themselves. \n\n== Entrepreneurs ==\nEntrepreneurs need access to a talent pool to start building their team. They need resources and connections to create their prototype, wander the IP minefield, and find funding to bring their product to market.\n\n==Artists and Crafters==\nArtists' biggest requests so far have been studio space. Further cross discipline connections and resources can also help in trying new avenues of expression.\n\n==Professional Engineers==\nThese members are professionals well into their careers and should have some income to be invested in their future. We will want to sell them on setting out to pursue their dream rather than staying at a job they may be dissatisfied with. Another interesting concept to be exploited is that engineers who use their companies equipment may find themselves mired in IP rights issues. \n\nProfessional engineers are hungry for this, too. They need space outside of their companies to grow and work as innovations made inside their company can lead to problematic IP rights. They also need a place to bring their kids and family to interest them in science and technology education. The Mechanical Engineers we've met, on both the wood and metal side, have found many of their tools fairly commoditized. However, more and more they yearn for community. The garage is a lonely place to innovate.\n\n==Kids==\nKids are really important to HeatSync Labs, too. We need to stop hiding the tools of creation from them. They need to grow up in a world around tools and the creators in the community so they understand that these these options are available to them and so they can begin building their knowledge network early.\n\nOur public schools need help! Schools can't afford to fund many experiments and projects that would help solidify learned concepts at a younger age. It is often left up to teachers and parents to fund these things. By working with the teachers and parents in the community we have been able to supply their kids with the tools and consumables needed to complete these projects. Through programs like Lego League and the electronics/mechanical workshops we host we can start to groom the next generation inventors/engineers/artists.\n\nThats not all the groups we target, however. Photographers, Scientists, the curious and motivated are all important! We want to challenge any passerby into walking in and we want to put a tool in their hand. It is time to return to the tools of creation to our people!\n\n=Marketing Plan(sales strategy, pricing, advertising, and promotion)=\nWe're looking to find the curious and motivated, be it by word of mouth, walk by traffic, press, advertising or social networking via twitter, linked in, or facebook.\n\n*'''Associate Member''' - $25 per month, and you get your name on the list of members and access to the lab and shared equipment during the hours of operation.\n*'''Basic Member''' - $50 per month, and you get the benefits of associate membership, plus 24/7 access to the lab, including a key to the building and security code. This also includes personal project space for a banker box (box provided by HeatSync Labs.)\n*'''Plus Member''' - $75 per month, and you get all the benefits of basic membership, plus a locker in the lab!\n\nIn general wed like to advertise on location with presentations and discussion groups.  Advertising in magazines, blogs, and utilizing google adwords will also be important. Finally we would like to look into sponsorships of local makers, from students to FRC teams to trips to conventions and funding projects, wed like to make sure local Makers are getting the resources they need.\n\n===Entrepreneurs===\nTechCrunch and other online sites have fetishized the startup lifestyle and it will be important to capitalize on this with students, hobbyists and entrepreneurs. Participating in and speaking on panels for events like ASU's Global Entrepreneur Week and at the Arizona Tech Council will advertise us as the obvious place to go when first developing product prototypes and looking for partners on a startup team.\n\n===Students and Hobbyists===\nOutreach to students should be done on campus. Poster advertising is free, and student ambassadors would be cheap to hire. Another method of reaching these users could be through speeches and presentations on campus. Student groups will be another excellent way of reaching the demographic. Linux Users Groups and on campus engineering fraternities and societies will be a valuable resource.\n\nBeing ingrained in the Make culture is the big way to reach hobbyists. Make Magazine, blog.makezine.com, hackaday.com, and hackerspace advertising are the way to reach these part time inventors. Visits and promotions through local hobby shops will also be important.\n\n===Artists===\nFind these people throughout the local groups spread across the valley. Events like First Friday in downtown phoenix are teaming with artists. From what we've gathered talking to artists at these events what they are mainly looking for is space to work in. Organizations like Urban Stew pair art and technology for public art shows. Targeting students on the campuses can draw in artists. Pairing with vendors and local art stores for discounts can help those establishments and be incentive to join our community. We can pull in artists with photography competitions, showings/galleries, and free nights for groups to use tools.  We want to also target the craft/DIY communities. We can reach these groups through web sites like Ravelry and the Craft Blog, and visits to local shops like Tempe Yarn.  Groups like PHY DIY and Geek Girls have huge groups of crafters doing interesting work in the valley already.  It will be necessary to offer to host one of their monthly events at our location to acclimate them to our offerings. Finally, DIY music mainly happens online.  Matrix Synth (http://matrixsynth.blogspot.com/) and Synth-DIY (http://www.synthdiy.com/) are popular music communities.  Promotions at local music shops and college music groups will also be important.\n\n\n===Professionals (Engineers)=== \nThe way to reach these users will be through their professional society and through professional publications.  Electrical engineers utilize resources such as IEEE publications, Circuit Cellar, Nuts and Volts, Wired and possibly Linux publications and the IEEE Phoenix membership is 3,600 members strong. Mechanical engineers have local users groups throughout the valley already.  Groups like Valley Metal bring together hobbyist mechanical engineers to talk about their projects.  Inviting them into our location to host their monthly meeting will be important. They can also be reached through publications like SAE, Invention & Technology Mag and SciAM.\n\nAnother good avenue will be trade shows and strategic partnerships. It may be possible to work with the big electronics vendors including Jameco, Digikey, and Newark to cross promote by being a local presence for these online companies.\n\n===Scientists and Academics===\nNovel papers, conferences, good work.\n\n===Kids===\nIn order to raise awareness, excitement and understanding of HeatSync amoung kids aged 5-17 we mainly target their parents and educators.  Current opportunities include Sponsorship and volunteering with First Lego League and First Robotics Competition. Additionally we may present to parent-teacher organizations and host STEM activities within the local school and district levels.\n\n=Current Business Accomplishments=\n\n===Workshops===\n\nMonthly we run a free to attend Arduino workshop where we train kids to adults how to program micro-controllers. Hundreds of people have attended our monthly meetings with the goal of empowering themselves with technology to solve their own problems. The Arduino development platform was created in a classroom setting and it's community is based around using the technology for educational purposes. People with no programming or electronics experience can sit down with us for a couple hours and learn to code their own program to flash LEDs, send messages to screens, actuate motors, and more. \n\nMost recently we had been asked to create a workshop series on soldering and programing for UrbanStew, another local nonprofit. Again, we wanted to instill the values of creation, having our attendees actually BUILD the computer they would eventually program. We did this with a goal of demystifying these devices which are increasingly becoming ubiquitous.\n\n===Public Meetings===\n\nWe have hosted over 24 free public educational events this year. Every 1st and 3rd Thursday we invite in a speaker to invigorate both our audience and usually the speaker! From materials, to tools, to processes we want to empower our people with the knowledge they need to succeed. Topics have included:\n\n*PaperCraft\n*Glass Working\n*Working with Acrylic\n*Thermoforming plastics\n*Lathing metals\n*CAD/CAM Introduction\n*3D prototyping and fabrication\n*PCB Layout and Design with Eagle Cad\n*PCB Chemical Etching, Heat Transfer, with FeCl\n*Near Space Project Ballooning\n*High Speed Photography\n*Monster Plush Party - Recycling old toys by sewing them together with electronics\n\n===Weekly Events===\n\nIn addition to our Thursday bi-weekly speaker series, we host events all week long.  The two recurring series to note are our Augmenting Humanity and 3D Printing nights. Augmented Humanity consists of a blend of ubiquitous computing, wearable computing and research and development into accessibility through technology. Notable projects include Bryan Duarte's work with the Arduino development platform to aid himself and other blind individuals to solve their own problems themselves by utilizing technology.  Bryan's work is just one of the many fascinating projects that happen on Mondays.\n\nEvery Wednesday we host a 3D Printing event where we foster the innovative field of personal manufacturing. 3D printers have long been out of reach of the individual inventor and entrepreneur, but falling costs and several open source projects are changing all that.  These devices are finally realizing the promises of the Star Trek Replicator, creating 3d, multi material objects before your eyes! Even more mind bending is the idea of the machine creating the machine which is a focus of the open source Replicating Rapid Prototyper (RepRap) project we are involved with.\n\n===Large Scale Projects===\nOur weekly work feeds into our larger scale mission of educating and fostering entrepreneurism among our population.  \n\n====Internal====\nThroughout the summer of 2009 HeatSync members planned and developed a 4lb payload which they intended to send to around 90,000ft using only a helium balloon.  Anyone from the public was welcome to join the development team and learn the multidisciplinary fundamentals necessary to launch an object into near-space! The package was fitted with sensors, cameras and radios to store data and communicate with the ground.  August 28th 2009 was the culmination of several months of preparation for the SyncFleet team.  In the end the balloon burst at ~75k feet into the upper atmosphere and returned safely home on its parachute. More than 40 people attended launch, from children to adults, who then helped us 'chase' down the landing.\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/teamdroid/4935433891/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/teamdroid/4935422607/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/25968780@N03/4936065787/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/25968780@N03/4936064759/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/teamdroid/4936018950/\n\nTwo new teams, HelioSync and HeatSEM, have formed around new goals.  HelioSync aims to investigate issues related to solar power generation and storage. A rocket engineer, turbine engineer, electrical engineers, students and hobbyists are all working to adapt an MIT design for a solar collector. The goal is to leverage our location in the Arizona desert to further understand renewable energy problems and solutions. \n\nOur other project, HeatSEM, was formed when we heard from high schools, colleges and hobby scientists that Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was costly and out of reach.  SEM microscopy works a lot like a traditional CRT television by aiming electrons at the material to be magnified.  The electrons that are converted to alternate forms of energy are measured and turned into a visible image!  HeatSEM will bring down the cost of SEM microscopy by a magnitude or more over this next year.  \n\n====Outreach====\nThroughout this past year we focused on education, not only internally, but externally. It was our joy to mentor our first First Lego League(FLL) teams. Our kids, mostly 9-year-olds, worked throughout 2010 Body Forward Challenge, as the FLL puts it, to \"explore the cutting-edge world of Biomedical Engineering to discover innovative ways to repair injuries, overcome genetic predispositions, and maximize the body's potential, with the intended purpose of leading happier and healthier lives.\" They learned computer programming and mechanical and biological engineering concepts culminating in a team presentation and robot competition. The goal, again here, was to empower them to solve THEIR OWN problems. Our technique was entirely discovery learning and the adults were only there to supervise and answer questions. It was the first year for our kids and they had amazing fun. In addition our mentor won best mentor for the season.\n\nRecently we've waded into science education waters. Many classrooms can't afford to put money down for the equipment needed to perform hands on experiments that shine light on the theory that kids learn in the classroom. We found a local teacher on [http://www.donorschoose.org/ donorschoose.org] looking for help funding science education materials. Since then we've been working with her to help develop, implement and fund her science course ware. Our first two labs included an earthquake simulation on student built toothpick structures and an examination of strawberry DNA. Further, we've found that these labs are only needed once per year and storage is also a challenge for teachers so we've begun building a storehouse of lab materials which we intend to provide to more classrooms throughout this year.\n\n===Donations===\n\nDonations have been a key to our success from the outset. They are how the majority of our community show their support. Usually these donations are not necessarily monetary, but rather equipment based.\n\nWhen we finally started pulling the space together in 2009, the first donations to come in were standard hand tools including hammers, wrenches, drivers, saws, etc. \n\nWith hand tools covered our community moved on to create our electronics lab. Thousands of dollars in electronics and test equipment rolled into the space over the course of several months. These donations included oscilloscopes, dc power supplies, soldering equipment, and standard electronic components.\n\nWhat we really needed at this point was pieces of high priced and attention grabbing equipment that couldn't necessarily be found in anyones garage. Historically, 3D prototyping had been priced out of reach of the general public at $10,000 and up. A new device was changing that though. The Rep Rap is a free design for an affordable 3D Printer that claims it can be built with simple hand tools and electronics equipment for around $1000 in parts. We raised that $1000 in 5 days.\n\nBy summer we were months into working on our 3d printing technology and had serious needs in the mechanical engineering department. The community turned its attention to larger metal working equipment. Again thousands of dollars in metal working equipment including a band saw, 7x10 lathe and drill presses arrived. At the same time our members approached the local manufacturer Taig about a deal on their beautiful Mini Lathes. We were apprehensive about our ability to convince them as our 501c3 still had not cleared. We walked away the same day with a machine worth $400.\n\nIn December we continued our started campaign to bring in exclusive and approachable tools. We began an innovative donation drive to collect $7500 to purchase a 700lb. Laser Cutter. We utilized the online fund-raising platform Kickstarter.com and were able to beat our fundraising goal of $7500 in under 30 days, by bringing in almost $10,000!\n\nIn January there was nothing to do but wait for our Laser Cutter to be manufactured and shipped. During this time Welding became a hot topic in the lab. A Mig welder, welding cart, and welding table, at least $500 in value, were donated allowing us to begin holding welding workshops.\n\nWe don't necessarily know what the big donation drive will be, but when this community needs something, it reaches it's goals.\n\n=Development plan=\nHeatSync has already shown to be a successfully entity throughout its almost 2 years of operation.  We're proud of our current accomplishments, but have much more we want to do. We've finally outgrown our current home at Gangplank and as such the board has created a committee to begin searching for new space in the Phoenix Metro region. \n\nThe attributes necessary to make HeatSync successful include access to transportation, centrality, the proper mix of 'industrial' and 'retail' space, vitality of community, and room for growth.\n\nTransportation and centrality to us means aligning ourselves around the north 202, 101, 60 and the light rail project to allow allow us to continue to target the brightest minds in the entire valley.\n\nWhat makes our search difficult is a need for an ackward mix of 'light industrial' and 'retail' type space. On the industrial side we are a workshop and so we need heavy power, 210 or even 3phase, either bay doors or double doors, and to be a little bit noisy and messy. On the retail side we intend to provide a face to the world that is approachable and comfortable.  We host public meetings, presentations, technical workshops and periodic events/celebrations which typically bring in 30 people on average but have brought in more than a hundred on occasion.  Note not all these activities need be on site.  It is also acceptable and sometimes preferable to utilize nearby 'community' space for events.\n\nFurther, the site must have a pre existing community.  The location should have a 'story to tell.' We're building something bigger than HeatSync labs itself and community is a bit part of that.  The point of HeatSync is to bring the tools of creation out of the industrial districts and back to the people.  Communities that have been brainstormed so far include the Phoenix Roosevelt Row Arts District, the Tempe Farmer Arts District, and the Mesa Main Street District.  These area are all thriving cultural locations indicative of what we're looking for.\n\nFinally, we need room for growth.  Moving is very stressful to a membership based organization and as such we are seeking a longterm partner to make sure this next move will be the one that puts us in either in our final home, or one clear step away from it.\nWe currently have around 25 members and we fill up about 1000+ sq./ft., though we utilize project rooms and the main room for presentations and meetings so we're used to having access to approximately 5000+ sq./ft.  Our current workshop needs require 500+ sq./ft. to safely house our workshop with our current equipment and our newest addition of a laser cutter. Further we intend to grow over the next year or two adding another 500+sq.ft of space for tools including a Shopbot, Plasma Cutter, Injection molder and Industrial Sewers. \n\nFurther we intend to grow over the next year to 40-50 members and we intend for this location to be able to support that growth.  \n\nFinal membership growth looks aims to reach approximately 75-100 members which it is expected to max out at based on research into community intimacy, space and safety constraints.  Ideally there will be a clear next step or a growth opportunity at the location to be able to handle that eventuality as well.\n\nEstimates put our current space needs at at least 1000 sq feet with available community space, but more realistically as much as 3000 sq ft. could easily be utilized.\n\nA current survey of pricing puts a space meeting our requirements at between $1500 and $2000 a month including utilities. At that rate we're clearly projecting a shortfall of around $6000 over the first 6 months assuming no growth. Stagnant growth seems unlikely however. Based on current growth rates we expect to be able to cover this shortfall within that 6 months.  However, current actions are being taken to save money prior to the move to ensure stability. We have also raised larger sums from our community in the past, but we again want to find consistent realistic sources of revenue.\n\n= Management Plan=\n==Principals (The Board of Directors)==\n\n===Jeremy Leung - Champion===\n\n'''Qualifications:''' A self-proclaimed jack of all trades stemming from his interest in any thing he can get his hands on, Jeremy Leung is a maker.

We share a love for accessibility and ubiquitous computing and are currently looking into grant opportunities.\n*'''Larry C. Kennedy Elementary School''' - We've begun partnering with schools as well.  In early 2011 we began working with Julia Tisdale, a science teacher, who reached out requesting donations of money tools and consumables required for class experiments.  So far we have assisted on an earthquake simulation study where kids build structures that can withstand a simulated earthquake, and a strawberry DNA extraction experiment where kids learned to extract DNA!\n*'''Gangplank HQ''' - We partnered with Gangplank beginning in 2010 and grew along with them.  We're most proud of our mentoring partnership for the 2010 FIRST Lego League robotics competition and our partnership on the Intel Meego Development event. \n*'''Urban Stew''' - Urban Stew is a nonprofit which explores synergies between art, technology, and culture. We have now partnered for various electronics workshops hosted by MadCap Theatre in Tempe and a First Friday event in downtown Phoenix where we partnered to teach basic electronics and robotics.\n*'''O'Reilly Press''' - The O'Rielly group has long worked within the maker community with their Make and Craft publications and their MakerFaire national conference/science fair.  We've got strong ties to their group and we are now working to host a Maker Faire event in the Phoenix Area.\n*'''Global Hacker Spaces''' - The hackerspace movement is a global phenomenon and as such we have partners throughout the United States, and the world.  We're working to create a nonprofit umbrella organization to aid people around the world in creating hacker spaces in their locations. Collaborating with teams around the world allows us to find the best minds to work on solutions for projects.\n\n== Professional Resources==\n\n*Shelley Detwiller DiGiacomo - Lawyer\n:Osborn Maledon\n:(602) 640-9358\n:www.omlaw.com\n\n*Carolyn Sechler - CPA\n:(602) 230-2700\n:http://www.azcpa.com/\n\n=Financial Plan(funding requirements, financial statements, analysis)=\n\n==Capital(Our monetary status and funds?)==\n\n==Assets==\nIt won't be surprising to know that the majority of our assets include our tools and equipment. In addition to a great set of standard hand tools we have tools ranging from metal working to wood working to prototyping and more. \n\n===Metal===\n*Sieg Mini Mill\n*7x10 Mini Lathe\n*Taig Micro Lathe\n*CNC Mini Lathe\n*Drill Presses\n*Band Saw\n*Mig welder\n\n===Wood===\n*Scroll Saw\n*Skill Saw\n*Jig Saw\n\n===Plastic and Prototyping===\n*100 Watt 4'x2' Laser Cutter\n*Rep Rap 3D Printer\n*Makerbot Cupcake-clone 3D Printer\n*Vacuum forming Table\n\n===Electronics===\n*Wide selection of electronics components (DIP and SMD)\n*2 Oscilloscopes, analog and digital\n*4 DC power supplies\n*Complete Soldering (DIP and reflow) setup\n*10+ sets of soldering equipment for workshops and training\n\n===Microcontrollers===\n*Large and diverse stock of microcontrollers and programmers (PIC, ATMEL(Arduino), Texas Instruments)\n*Large stock of sensors and actuators for microcontroller projects\n\n===Material Handling===\n*Palette Jack\n*Lift Table\n\n===Misc===\n*Mechanical Engraver\n*Air Compressor\n\n==Membership== \nA membership model has been the core of our support over our first year. This recurring income is the backbone of our financial support. It is our intention to utilize this stable income to pay all fixed costs.  Metrics based on our current membership data include:\n\n*An average of 2 members per month added over the past year.\n*Average growth rate of greater than 200% over the previous 3 months.\n*77% of members are in the basic (middle rate plan)\n*Only 2 members to attrition over the entire year.\n\n==Donations==\nQuantify dollar amount for donations received\n\n==Fundraisers==\n\nWhile memberships pay the rent, and donations fill the space with tools, fundraising has been important in raising funds to cover any further operational costs. Throughout the past year we tried many innovative fundraisers including Water Balloon fights, LAN parties, Barbecues, and a Poker Night. We continue to adapt and deliver our community value for their donation.  Further, there are many more traditional fundraising options that we have yet to attempt. Dinners, Raffles, and Auctions are all being considered this year. Our last fundraiser, a mix of birthday party, science fair and electronic music show, targeted 100 donors for $10 each and reached that goal easily. More importantly, it is still regarded highly in the community. It is our intention to both continue, and grow, these 'nightlife' style fundraisers. \n\n==Grants==\n\nAs we've previously shown, our Membership, Donations and Fundraising fully support the organization. We could simply stop there, but it was our goal early on to become something bigger. The completion of our 501c3 process opens the door to local and national grants for original science and technology research. Members are currently doing innovative research in accessibility, education, neurosciences, and renewable energy and it is our goal to find ways to fund these projects. Most importantly we have the amazing benefit of many large scale technology companies nearby that are looking to fund innovative new ideas. We have located and are targeting opportunities with:\n\n*Intel\n*Honeywell\n*Avnet\n*Verizon\n*Motorola\n*Microchip\n*Freescale\n*Raytheon\n*General Dynamics\n*Lockheed Martin\n*Boeing\n\nFurther, many of those companies already have employees that frequent our space who have expressed interest in helping us pursue these opportunities. We don't intend to ever rely on such an unstable source of income, but we do look forward to adding it to our revenue stream.",
