Overall, I'm really unqualified to give you help here, but this is where I'll document as I learn.\n\n= Clear Acrylic =\nThe trick here is to mirror your engrave.  You want to be engraving on the \"backside\" of the acrylic because it looks better.  As a result, you'll need to use the \"mirror\" when you go to engrave.  Create your design as you want to see it, and then just do it in software at the end.\n\n= Other Materials =\nDocument some stuff here.\n\n[[Category:Laser]]",
