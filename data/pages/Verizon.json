    "text": "==Proposal Narrative== \n\nOur colleague Brian is blind. He is amazingly self sufficient in life with his wife and 3 kids. He loves technology and the ways it empowers him in his daily routine. He uses JAWS, a screen reader, to use his computer and programs it to automate and solve his own problems. He even writes a blog about his trials and tribulations with accessibility.\n\nWe treat Brian no differently than we treat anyone else at our space. The day he found us we put an Arduino in his hand and expected him to program it. Arduino was designed to make electronics design, programming and prototyping easy enough for kids, but deep enough for professionals. It took some time to explain its non accessible layout to him but within a few hours he had programmed it to play Pink Panther through a speaker!\n\nHe was hooked on programming which could make changes in the real world, where he could solve his own problems. He decided to pursue a degree in computer engineering. However, when he talked to the Disability Resource Office they warned that his chances of success in that degree program would be very limited. Without a tactile representation of the different components and access to the tools needed to interact with these components they couldn't guarantee a fair playing field. \n\nWe talked with Brian many nights about this, about his success with Pink Panther, and about the problems he had to admit to himself. The Arduino IDE was barely accessible. He was only able to program the Arduino in the first place because a sighted person counted out the pins on the board to him and gave him the speaker explaining which pins would go where on the board. \n\nBut there was too much potential for this device for blind people. If the micro processor could control robots, access wifi, control cameras, lights, speakers, and lots of other components for sighted users, why could it not do the same for the blind? \n\nBlind people love technology because it allows them to be self sufficient and solve their own problems. There are devices out for the blind that cost hundreds of dollars if not thousands to assist them in measuring water, identifying colors, and notify them of things around them. But how can the world be made accessibly by those who don't understand the needs of the blind? And how can the blind solve their problems if the tools are not accessible? \n\nWith the Arduino the blind person could program their own device to do these same functions for a fraction of the cost, or solve NEW problems.\n\nAnd it wouldn't be that difficult to make Arduino accessible. All of the hardware and software designs are available for free online. The Arduino team is a loose confederation of liked minded individuals around the world working to make the product better.\n\nWe intend to make TOOLS of life accessible to the blind so they can participate and solve their problems on their own.\n\nJoin us.\n\n==Program Participants==\n\n<!--\n==Program Participants Description== \n\nWho are your program participants and how many will you serve? What are the key\ncharacteristics of these participants and are they in any way different from\nthe full set of people who have the problem? \nIn characteristics, we are interested not just in such factors as gender and\nrace, but also defining who you serve by the degree of the challenge to get to\nthe result you intend. We know, for example, that it is much harder to get\nchildren to the right literacy level if they are two, rather than one, grades\nbehind in reading and if their primary language is not English. Please know\nthat we view it as a sign of strength that a program/project has defined the\npeople who are most likely to benefit from a particular approach. It is rare\nthat one program is the best fit for everyone. \n-->\n\nThe focus of this project is directed towards the blind and/or low vision. Students, professionals, kids, adults, it doesn't matter. Anyone with a passion for technology and a love of problem solving and learning. As a development project, though, we would need some software engineers with a knowledge of the Arduino software and the java langauge. We would also need hardware engineers that can make changes to the Arduino hardware.\n\n==For Whom Will You Address This Cause== \n\n<!--\n==For Whom Will You Address This Cause Description== \nSpecifically state for whom you will address this cause.\n-->\n\nThe program will directly effect the blind and low vision technology\nenthusiasts around the world who have never before had access to programming or\nbuilding on a micro processor. As an open source program the Arduino IDE will\nbenefit blind users around the world with a simple download. The Arduino\nhardware is a micro processor that is low in cost ranging any where from $30 to\n$80 depending on the components included.\n\n\n==Providing Service==\n\n<!--\n==Providing Service Description== \n\nWhat level of intensity (i.e. frequency of service) and duration (i.e. period\nin which you provide service for a person) are needed for your approach to\ndeliver results? Once you give the number add your thought on rationale. \n-->\n\nThe Arduino language has great tutorials found online, along with example\nscripts found right in the menu of the IDE. For the blind users we will provide\na detailed layout and description of the hardware,. Also as a supplement to the\ndescription of the hardware we will have Braille or tactile labels for each\ncomponent of the hardware. There are online forums and mailing lists directed\ntowards programmers of the arduino found online at www.sparkfun.com. \n\n\n==Partners & Organizations== \n\n\n<!--\n==Partners & Organizations Description== \n\nThe Arduino language has great tutorials found online, along with example\nscripts found right in the menu of the IDE. For the blind users we will provide\na detailed layout and description of the hardware,. Also as a supplement to the\ndescription of the hardware we will have Braille or tactile labels for each\ncomponent of the hardware. There are online forums and mailing lists directed\ntowards programmers of the arduino found online at www.sparkfun.com. \n-->\n\nLocally we have ties with the CUBIC lab at Arizona State University. For a decade they've worked on accessibility problems from the user point of view. \n\nACBVI locally works to enhance the quality of life for blind and visually impaired. Cubic has worked with them to understand the needs of the blind community and to evaluate products in development.\n\nOther important establishments to reach out to will be blind schools such as state schools\nfor the Deaf and Blind, and training centers for the blind as in Colorado\ncenter for the Blind. Partners like this could be trained and deliver the\ntraining to many ethnic backgrounds, age groups, and genders of the blind\ncommunity.\n\nGlobal community of other makerspaces.\n\n==Verizon Volunteers== \n<!--\n==Verizon Volunteers Description== \n\nCould you possibly use Verizon employees or retirees as volunteers in this or\nother programs/projects? (required) We'd like to alert Verizon employees and\nretirees who live or work in your area to your need for more help to go with\nany financial investment we might make. Please think creatively about how you\nmight use additional hands-many of them are very skilled in a variety of ways\nas mothers and fathers and civic contributors-not just as productive members of\nour company. \n-->\n\nI think this could be useful if we get to a point where we need drivers to\nlocations, assistance in training, or in making calls for feedback and stats. We could also look into an accessibility tech support chatline and hotline to answer questions.\n\n==Mission==\n<!--\nWhat is your mission and vision and any key points of approach?  If you have\nany principles or values that are actively used in your programs and management\nplease include them as well.  \n\n==Guidance:==\n\nWe see mission as what you do and vision as the end state you wish to achieve.\nThe best mission and vision statements are short and clear. If yours is over\nthe length here allowed, please distill to the essence.  We are especially\ninterested in how your mission gives you concentration and focus—discouraging\nyou from simply taking on more projects because money is available. Finally, if\nyou have points of approach (values, principles, whatever you might call them)\nthat guide where you go or how you work, do name them and be specific about how\nthey shape your actions.  \n\n==Examples:==\n\nThe mission of the Davis Health Alliance is to insure that low income and at\nrisk individuals in our county get and use health care services. Our vision is\nof a county in which no preventable illness or condition goes unaddressed and\nno gap in health outcomes based on means, ethnic status or other measure\ncreates disparity. \n\n\nWe have a core belief that behavioral choice is as consequential to health as\nis the full total of medical science and its delivery.  \n\n\nThe mission of School Turnaround is to reverse decline in failing public\nschools. Our vision is of American schools in which all students achieve at or\nabove grade level. Our strong belief is that every child achieves—no\nexceptions, no excuses. We are driven by the belief that a child should only be\nin first grade once.  \n-->\n\n\nHeatSync Labs' mission is to provide the tools, space and the community for\nstudents, entrepreneur, artists and garage tinkerers to come together and\ncreate their dreams.  We are a community workshop which promotes Do-It-Yourself\nscience and education and prides ourselves on application -in addition- to\ntheory.\n\nOur vision is a world where we re-awaken our population and reinstate the\nknowledge of creation in opposition to our throw-away society.  We will empower\nour population delivering the confidence to once compete on a global scale.\n\n= Achievements =\n<!--\nWhat have you achieved in the past three years for persons in your programs\nthat are most like the project for which you seek our support?\n\n==Guidance:==\nPlease know we are much more impressed with how many people have tangibly\nimproved their life than on how much money you have attracted or what awards\nyou may have received—unless the recognition is clearly based on participant\noutcomes.  Also, we do not equate growth with achievement. Just focus on the\ntangible human gains you have created for those you serve. \n\n==Examples:==\nIn the past three years we have worked with 210 women at risk for low birth\nweights and other problems.  Doctors estimate that for this group, about 15\nwomen would be expected to give birth to a child with a generally preventable\ncondition.  With our program, that number was seven.\n\nWe have worked to date in 52 schools. In 50 of these academic achievement gains\nof 15% or more in numbers of children at grade level in critical subjects were\nrealized.  \n-->\n\n\nMonthly we run a free to attend arduino workshop where we train kids to adults\nhow to program microcontrollers.  Hundreds of people, from children to adults\nhave attended our monthly meetings with the goal of empowering themselves with\ntechnology to solve their own problems.  MORE HERE\n\nMost recently we had been asked to create a workshop series on soldering and\nprograming for UrbanStew another local nonprofit.  Again, we wanted to instill\nthe values of creation, having our attendees actaully BUILD the computer they\nwould eventually program.  Demystifying these devices which are increasingly\nbecoming ubiquoutous.\n\nWe have hosted over 24 free public educational events this year.  Every 1st and\n3rd Thursday we invite in a speaker to invigorate us, and them.  From\nmaterials, to tools, to processes we want to empower our people with the\nknowledge they need to succeed.  Topics have included: *Astronomy\n*Eagle PCB Layout and Design\n*PCB Chemical Etching,Heat Transfer, with FeCl\n*Haptic interfaces\n*Lock Picking\n*Cube.ly 3D printer\n*PaperCraft\n*Thermoforming\n*Idaho Near Space Project Balloon Communications Payload\n*High Speed Photography\n*Haystack Project\n*Working with acrylic\n*Glass Working\n*Rep Rap made easy\n*Teardown party(everyone brings a peice of electronics to tear down for parts in order to understand)\n*Lathing for fun and profit\n*EL Wire\n*Monster plush party (Disassembling plush dolls and sewing them back together with electronics)\n*Coffee Science and Arduino\n*Arduino and VOIP - Dial-a-Lulz\n*CAD/CAM introduction\n*Home Brewing\n\n\nThroughout this past year we also took time out to coach a pair of First Lego\nLeague teams. Our kids, mostly 9r olds,  worked throughout 2010 Body Forward\nChallenge, as the FLL put its to \"explore the cutting-edge world of Biomedical\nEngineering to discover innovative ways to repair injuries, overcome genetic\npredispositions, and maximize the body's potential, with the intended purpose\nof leading happier and healthier lives.\"    They learned computer programming,\nmechanical engineering and biological engineering concepts culminating in a\nteam presentation and robot competition!  The goal, again here, was to empower\nthem to solve THEIR OWN problems.  It was entirely discovery learning and the\nadults were only there to supervise and answer questions.  It was the first\nyear for our kids and they had amazing fun.  In addition our mentor won best\nmentor for the season.\n\n=Similar Groups=\n<!--\nIn your geographic area what groups are most similar to you? And what\ndifferentiates you from them?\n\n==Guidance:==\nFew groups are so unique they have no comparable organizations.  We want to\nknow who you see as most similar so that we can both look at a broader picture\nof groups approaching the same issues within an area and gain a sense of how\nyou are different.  This question encourages you to tell us what we should\nremember about you that makes you stand out in some ways. Please do not do so\nby a critique of other groups. Speak to your own strengths. \n\n==Examples:==\n\nThe Care Network of St. Mary’s Hospital and the Health Advocacy Forum are the\nclosest organization we can define. The Network is somewhat different in\nproviding a vertical connection from prevention to post-treatment services for\npatients and customers of this 450 bed hospital. We, in contrast, are looking\nhorizontally and community wide at how to integrate health providers and\nservices. The Forum is distinct in that it focuses on the rights of\npeople—especially those low income and minority—to health care access. We are\nless focused on defending rights than meeting needs.\n\n\nWe have several kinds of comparable groups. One is the set of alternative\nprograms that focus on professional development for principals and other\nadministrators.  Over 100 discreet “packaged” programs exist for purchase and\nuse by school districts and regional agencies.  None have substantial market\nshare. The other comparable area is programs that focus on reversing failure in\nprogrammatic rather than leader-driven ways. An example is Success For All, a\nmajor reading program used in hundreds of schools nationwide. It provides a\nprescribed approach for using a dedicated block of time devoted daily in\nschools to literacy development.\n\n\nWe are different from these and other groups primarily because of our strong\nintervention approach. We literally see turnaround as a way of hitting failure\nhard. At the same time we are compatible in that we work with a wide variety of\nexisting programs—be they for professional development, curriculum, or\nteaching. Our focus is on helping principals spark and lead change and on fully\nexecuting existing models and approaches—many of which work but only if more\nrobustly implemented. \n-->\n\n\nWe're most like a vocational school, though without the classes.  We're also like a traditional academic incubator model mixed with the newer accelerator model where entrepreneurs and skilled tradespeople who don't wish to work\nin an office alone but would rather work side by side with the other brightest\nminds in the community in order to build their workspace in public\n\nMore specifically, we are part of a larger maker/do-it-yourself culture\nexemplified by Make Magazine.  There are spaces are popping up throughout the\nunited states, and globally, all with different visions and goals, but all\nlisting themselves at hackerspaces.org.\n\nLocally we are most like our peer coworking/collaboration sister and previous landlord,\nGangplank.  Gangplank, much like us, intends to revolutionize education,\ncommunity, and collaboration.  They currently are comprised more of web and mobile development, marketing and branding.\n\nWhat makes us different from all these is our focus on infrastructure and creation.  Even our schools are cutting vocational work due to budget constraints.  We refuse to back down. We intend to bring the tools of creation back to the people.\n\n= Participants =\n<!--\nWho are your participants?  What are the characteristics of the people you will\nactually include in your program and are they in any way different from the\nfull set of people who have the problem within your geographic focus?    \n\n==Guidance: ==\nPlease know that we view it as a sign of strength that a program has defined\nthe people who are most likely to benefit from a particular approach.  Think of\nhow Southwest Airlines wanted only those passengers who valued reliability and\nlow cost over other amenities. In the nonprofit world, it is rare that one\nprogram is always the best. Some kids, for example, thrive on a permissive and\nopen learning environment while others need tight structure.  We want to know\nif you have thought through the best fit with your treatment, approach,\nintervention or program by another name with specific people it will most help\nto achieve. \n\n\nThis section also gives you a place to tell us about relative degree of\nchallenge and to relate cost to degree of barriers. We know, for example, that\nthe difficulty and expense to get someone a job who is drug-addicted, has poor\nEnglish, or lacks a high school degree is very different than for people who\nhave none of these core issues.  We also encourage your speaking to the assets\nand strengths of your participants on which you can build. \n\n\n==Examples: ==\nOur approach is best fitted to pregnant women – whether young or older who lack\nboth knowledge of pre-natal care value and of a place to go to get it. We are\nless well suited to persons with more education and means who may well have\naccess to health care but don’t now choose to use it. Many smoke to excess, use\nalcohol or drugs, and have problems with weight gain. Our cost is relatively\nhigh as we are dealing with people who have historically had or used virtually\nno health care. We will work with 100 women in this category, most of whom have\nincredible self-reliance capabilities on which we can build.\n\n\nOur focus is on the principal and we believe we can be most successful when\nthey share two characteristics:  1) they have not been head of a failing school\nfor more than three years. (Beyond that we think they are more likely to be\npart of the problem than the solution.) and 2) they must believe that their\nschool is failing some of its students and that this is strongly unacceptable.\n(This eliminates the principals who acknowledge low test scores but note that\nthe reason is demographics, not anything they could do differently.)  This\nmeans that out of a market of 12,000 failing schools, we believe our approach\nis fitted to about 3,000 schools.  We will work with 50 schools next year\nwithin the latter group.\n-->\n\n\nWe will utilize our members and connections to the blind community to leverage\nour technological skills.  We are technologists who have several blind in our\nmidst, friends and families.  In addition we will utilize our allies within the\nblind community including XXXX  \n\n=Approach=\n<!--\nWhat approach are you using to achieve results?  \n\n==Guidance:  ==\nMost programs are not a random set of activities. They are a coherent strategy\nto achieve a result. Please do not offer us a detailed work plan. Rather, tell\nus a few core elements of your particular way of solving a problem and why you\nthink it is the best way to engage participants and help them get to the\nsuccess you have stated. If you could place this in the context of other\napproaches you might have used but didn’t, that would add to our understanding. \n\n==Examples:==\nOur approach has two key elements: 1) to develop a personal relationship with\npregnant women at strong risk of not getting and following medical guidance in\nsuch areas as diet, smoking, and exercise.  We see this relationship (which\nmost often is through a mentor, adult friend of other person who has a\nrelationship with the young woman) as critical to identify and build. And 2) we\nprovide all needed support services to the pregnant woman to deal with the\nissues that stand between that person and a healthy baby. These can involve\nhousing, money, or other factors beyond health. \n\n\nBefore deciding on this approach we looked at other models such as media\ncampaigns. Our conclusion:  No amount of information or pleading without this\npersonal relationship as the key to informing and persuading would be effective\nwith these young women.\n\n\nOur approach is intervention—with a set of principles used in turnaround in\nbusiness, hospitals, and other organizations. We focus solely on the principal\nas the key to a successful school and enter in the form of an intervention\nagent—our school turnaround specialist.  We use six specific strategies:\ndiagnosis, target-setting, messaging, use of data, alignment, and successful\nclassrooms. These are described in the separate document conveyed with this\nproposal. We are not successful because we have better ideas of improving\nschools. Our comparative advantage lies in executing strategy within schools in\na robust way—and concentrating our attention on the building leader as the key\nto change.\n-->\n\nWe then must survey and poll the blind and low vision community to find out more about their needs. We intend to hold workshops documenting the struggles blind and low vision users have when attempting to utilize the Arduino platform.\n\nOur goal here is to specifically not reinvent the wheel.  We will extend the existing Arduino hardware and software to make them accessible. Our approach will be to talk extensively with existing Arduino community on how to make our changes in such a way that they will be accepted with the least amount of resistance.  \n\nOur work will be focused in three areas:\n\nHardware-figure out a way to leverage existing technologies to represent braille on a pcb to identify components, inputs and outputs\n--through holes?\n--solder mask?\n--label chips somehow?\n-replace lights with motor or sound feedback\n\nSchematics\n-its like a map really, how might they see maps now\n-really should jump in with fritzing somehow\n\nSoftware-figure out how to make ide interface accessible\n-rewrite so screen readers can utilize all areas\n-debug and error messages, line numbers\n\nTo do this we will need to hire a software engineer to modify the IDE, a hardware engineer to modify the hardware designs, and a blind liaison to connect with the community and work with us day to day as we develop our solutions.\n\n=Intensity of Approach=\n<!--\nWhat level of intensity (i.e. frequency of service) and duration (i.e. period\nin which you provide service for a person) are needed for your approach to\ndeliver results? \n\n==Guidance:  ==\nOur sense is that many programs fail not because they are a bad approach but\nbecause they are not implemented with enough intensity or duration to make a\nlasting difference.   This is your chance to tell us what it really takes to\nachieve a result that sticks!   We are impressed with groups that have clear\nassumptions in this area and would rather invest in lower numbers that get a\nresult than high numbers who just get a service.  \n\n==Examples:==\nWe work intensively with two participant groups:  pregnant women and\nfriends/relatives who are influential with and supportive of that person. We\naverage five hours of contact with the helper and two with the pregnant woman\nper month during pregnancy and for one month after birth. Any less of an effort\nwould not we believe, have an effect on the health of the babies.\n\n\nWe include 6-8 site visits by a turnaround specialist to each school in our\nprogram. Any fewer would not keep up the focus. And more would lead to other\nforms of relationship that could well inhibit our intervention approach. We are\nnot trying to be the best friend or shoulder to cry on.  We are a change\npartner, accepted if not initially embraced for our ability to help principals\nlead to academic success.\n-->\n\n\n\n=Intended Outcomes=\n<!--\nWhat results are you committed to achieving — meaning outcomes from services —\nand for how many persons?   Please put the number who achieve in the context of\nthose who participate. \n\n==Guidance:==\nThe fact that people have completed a program, read your materials, sat through\ncounseling or a workshop is not a result. The result is what they get from what\nyou offer. This distinction is critical.  Please—focus on changes in behaviors\nand conditions for people—not on their activities in your programs or their\nlevel of satisfaction.  Please put the number who achieve in the context of the\nnumber you serve. \n\n\nIn most cases, you succeed because people change their behavior—whether to quit\nsmoking, exercise, wear a seat belt, or anything else.  We urge you to focus on\nbehaviors rather than attitudes because they are critical to success and much\nmore readily verified.  We do not know the value of increased self-esteem or\ncreating more positive attitudes toward something until you tell us as your\nresult what people can achieve with higher self-esteem or more positive\nattitudes than they could achieve without them. \n\n\nIn a few situations, you are focusing on a condition more than a behavior. For\nexample, the quality of a body of water or of a community’s level of social\ncapital. In either case, the more specific you are the better.\n\n\nWe urge you to suggest a clear result as you develop your program but then\nrevisit it when you have covered all elements in our format and thought it\nthrough as carefully as possible. The best targets are shaped by a complete\nunderstanding of your program.  \n\n==Examples:==\nWe will work with about 200 pregnant women at risk for low birth weight and\nother preventable infant issues in a 24 month period.  Of these, 175 or more\nwill deliver babies without preventable problems and within normal birth\nweights.\n\n\nOf the 35 schools in our program, at least 32 will achieve their turnaround\ntargets set for one school year. The minimal gain is a 15% increase over the\nprevious year in key specified subjects by those student groups (often\nminorities) that are lagging behind.  \n-->\n\n\n\nWe will empower the blind to solve problems for themselves by making the tools of creation accessible.  Specifically blind and low vision users will be able to hold and understand a commodity microcontroller board, utilize the programming environment through their screen reader, hold commodity products and understand them and how they connect, read schematics, and develop prototypes to enrich their lives.\n\n=How will you know?=\n<!--\nHow will you know when your expected results have been achieved?  What\ninformation or evidence will you use to verify success?\n\n==Guidance:==\nFoundations often ask you for an evaluation plan. We are much more concerned\nwith your looking at assessment as an integral part of what you do to track to\nand verify success.  Think of it this way: forget us—how will you know when to\ncelebrate success?\n\n\nVerification (yes or no—did you achieve stated results?) is easier and less\ncostly than evaluation (to answer the questions about what happened) but it is\nnot easy to approach. \n\n\nYou may well be able to use existing data bases or rely on existing measuring\ninstruments. Or you may be able to use observations and reports by others, or\nin some cases self-reported behaviors.  \n\n\n==Examples:==\nWe will verify achievement by hospital records and doctor reports as needed.\nWhile confidentially rightly restricts any individual information, the 3\nhospitals at which mothers in our program deliver have agreed to give us an\naggregate report (no names—just overall numbers) for the names we give them.\nThey have checked with ethics sources and agreed to do this as long as they\nreport five or more babies. With a smaller number they do not believe\nconfidentiality is preserved.\n\n\nWe use scores on the high stakes test to verify achievement. In those instances\nwhere the test is considered unreliable, we agree upon a different test. In\nthose instances where we might conceivably focus on creative writing,\nproblem-solving or other skills not readily measured by “tests”, we will rely\non established and explicit rubrics that are competency based and verified by\npersons not associated with those students or our program.   \n-->\n\n\n\n=Percentage user reached?=\n<!--\nAbout how many of the people in your result might reasonably achieve this gain\nif your program/project were not undertaken? How does your intended result\ncompare with what would have happened without you?  That is, how many people\nwould get to the result you state if you did not exist?\n\n==Guidance:==\nOur return on grant investment is not the result you set. It is the difference\nbetween your result and what would have happened without you. If for example, a\nprogram says that it will get 70 people out of 100 in a program to the\nachievement of getting and keeping a job but that evidence suggests that for\npeople like those served 50% generally get a job in a year, the value of the\nprogram is 20 jobs, not 70.\n\n\nWe are not asking you do original research. Just rely on whatever information\nexists about outcomes at the most specific level you can get it. Past rates of\nachievement in a school or neighborhood beat a district or a city. And a city\nbeats a state or the nation.  If no information exists, use the most educated\nguesses you can find.  Guidance counselors, for example, can often look at a\ndescription of your participants (or, better yet, a sample of names) and tell\nyou with reasonable accuracy about how many are likely to pass next year,\nbecome pregnant, use drugs, or experience another outcome.  \n\n\n==Examples:==\nOf the 100 high risk women with whom we will work the best projection is that\n20 will give birth to a child with some preventable issue, including low birth\nweight. Our target of no more than 5 women experiencing this problem is 15\nhealthy babies beyond what would have happened without our help. \n\n\nThe schools with whom we work have generally seen no rise in test scores in the\npast 2-3 years in the subjects where we set targets. Beyond this, our results\nof a 15% higher test score are set not to last year’s scores but what would be\npredicted by a trend line. For example, if a school has been going up by 5% a\nyear in achievement in an area, we set a target of 20% to be 15% higher than\nwhat would be projected without us.  \n-->\n\n\n\n=Broader Gains?=\n<!--\nAre there broader gains and benefits that will be realized if you are\nsuccessful that we should be aware of when considering your project/program?  \n\n==Guidance:==\nYou may have benefits to add such as:\n*The “life cycle” cost savings from solving a problem.\n*The value of model-building or testing with implications for many programs.\n*A test of ways to reduce costs, again with long term financial implications.\n\nPlease be specific.  We are less interested in broad contributions to values than in specific benefits for people and the organizations that support them.  \n\n==Examples:==\nThe average added cost nationally of a low birth weight baby in the first three\nyears of life is $30,000. For the 75 such conditions we anticipate preventing\nthe cost savings (to insurers and payers) is $2.25 million.  In addition the\ndisposition and skill in these women of getting and using information to change\nwhat they do to be successful is clearly generalizable to many aspects of their\nlife.\n\n\nThe impacts of a failing school are substantial.  Our average size school is\n700 students and our program, on average, is a direct factor in at least 25\nstudents staying in school and graduating high school.  The cost of each\ndropout (which is primarily due to lack of academic success) is projected at\nover $1 million in lost earnings and $600,000 for cost of added government\nsupport.  The total cost savings per school over the lives that are changed is\n$40 million. The long term gains in quality of life from core literacy and\nnumeracy capabilities are equally compelling.\n\n\nAnother impact concerns our methodology. We are showing many education funders\nthe indispensable value of coupling the up-front design work they do on\nbuildings, curriculums, and other matters with an in-school presence to insure\nrobust implementation of design.  \n-->\n\nWe will bootstrap an incredibly successful microcontroller project, make subtle changes to make it accessible, and push those changes back into the main project for them to include in all future releases of the hardware and software.  \n\nAs a result, this work will only need to be funded once. Every Arduino microcontroller made then now on and every download of the Development Tools by sighted users from now on will be accessible should the user be blind or visually impaired.\n\nThis is because Arduino is Open Source Hardware and Software. It is how the Arduino platform was built and why we're able to do this project, and why people after us will be able to build on our work.\n\n=Half Way goal?=\n<!--\nHalf way through your project, how will you know if participants are on course\nto achieve results with the time and money remaining?  \n\n==Guidance:==\nThe easy answer to this question is that we have spent half the money and are\non course with our work plan. This, unfortunately, says nothing about the\nrelationship between money spent and participant progress.  The key is to shift\nthe focus from what you do to what your participants are getting. We call these\ninterim success point milestones.\n\n\nThere are two ways to approach milestones that may work for you. First, you can\nlist your key activities and ask of each just what participants need to get.\nFor example, your activity might be to offer three workshops. The milestone\nquestion is what do participants need to get from those sessions to predict\nthat they will later change their behavior in the desired direction.\n\n\nThe second approach is just to ask yourself what predicts success. What do we\nknow to look for during the middle of a program that says participants are\n“getting it” or in other ways on track?  This approach as the value of insuring\na focus on predictive factors, which may well include:  1) how many people have\nalready achieved the result; 2) the number who are reflecting changes to\npredict later success; and 3) any key “infrastructure needed for full\nsuccess-whether a curriculum designed, an assumption tested, or anything else.  \n\n==Examples:==\nOur key predictive factors are as follows:\n\nEstablishing the key relationship we rely upon before the end of the first\nmonth of pregnancy.  We look for women who say they want to stay in touch with\nthis person and value the connection.\n\n\nEarly evidence of a person following medical or broader health advice. If we do\nnot see a change in behavior by the end of the second month (whether\neliminating smoking or excess drinking, exercising, or anything else) we are\nnot likely to see more major changes later. And we run out of time for changes\nto be consequential.\n\n\nWhere we are in danger of missing these milestones we get mobilized—up to and\nincluding an intervention with the woman in which substantial influence by\ncaring individuals is introduced but with no explicit coercion.  \n\n\nOur principals work with teachers to gain readings on child progress at four\npoints during the year. These are not “practice tests” but rather clear\ndemonstrations of the knowledge and competency that needs to build if a child\nis to pass the high stakes test in the Spring and become proficient in a core\nsubject.\n\n\nWhen insufficient number of students are on track at these four points in time,\ncourse corrections are made, first at the individual teacher level and then\nwith broader resource realignments as needed.  \n-->\n\nThis project is naturally divided between hardware and software projects, which are about equal in time and effort required. The natural progression is that we would be halfway done when either the hardware prototype is ready to be manufactured, or when our software changes our in the mainline Arduino IDE. \n\nHowever, these efforts could also be done in parallel if more than one person is hired to work on the project. The general progression is an iterative development process, where a number of prototypes are developed before the final product is completed. After our initial design phase, we would have a good overview of how many iterations we would need, and would be able to define milestones and dates.\n\n=Key People=\n<!--\nWho are the persons you see as critical to program/project achievement and what\nattributes of these people most predict success? \n\n==Guidance:  ==\nThis is a critical element in predicting project success. People are more\npowerful than great plans, a big committee, or even a lot of money in achieving\nresults.  While you may first consider resume details - e.g., degrees and years\nof experience—do recognize that in many areas, there is no strong correlation\nbetween these factors and ability to run an effective project.  Much research\nsuggests, for example, that on-job learning is far more useful to people than\nis what they learned in a classroom years ago.  And when a person has 20 years\nof experience that may be good or it may not!  For more depth on some\ncharacteristics of successful project leaders click here for\nhttp://www.rinstitute.org/sparkplugleaders. \n\n==Examples:==\nSuzie Johnson has strong passion about all babies having full life expectancy\nby being born within normal weight range and with no preventable health issues.\nShe has shown strong success at personally working with pregnant women and\nthose who most influence them to get and follow prenatal care while at the\nGuilford Hospital for 8 years.  She is tenacious and very energetic—and her\nenthusiasm spreads to all staff who works with her.   She is not an expert in\nprenatal care but knows how to connect participants to people who are.\n\n\nTurnaround Specialist, Margarita Sanchez commits to achieve the academic\nachievement gains stated for the four Ft. Worth elementary schools with which\nshe will work.  In addition to turning around two elementary schools while\nprincipal, Margarita last year worked with six elementary schools, in School\nTurnaround, which all hit their targets.  She is considered by the principals\nwith whom she works to be “strong medicine”.  They like her much better at the\nend of the year when for the first time they are progressing than they do after\none month!\n-->\n\n\n\n=Key partners/intermediaries=\n<!--\nAre any partners or intermediaries who must play a key role for you to achieve\nsuccess? If so, please list them here along with the role must they play and\nthe evidence that they are committed to play that role.\n\n==Guidance:==\nSome grant makers are fond of getting letters of support from political and\nother leaders.  For example, a banker notes that his bank is committed to\nlending $50 million to a given neighborhood.  That’s impressive only until you\nstop to think that is what banks do to make money! Unless there is a specific\ncommitment to lower rates or change credit standards, this is not a powerful\nstatement.\n\n\nPlease focus on those groups who have to play a role for you to be successful\nand on their commitments to play that role.  An intermediary is a group or\nperson (often a gatekeeper) whose behavior you do not control who must do\nsomething for you to succeed—and often just to enter a setting. A partner is a\ngroup whose skills or talents augment or counterbalance your own as a part of\nprogram delivery. \n\n\n==Examples:==\nWe rely on three major medical practices to change what they do to offer a\n“warmer” first experience for our at risk pregnant women.  Here are their\ncommitments.\n\n\nDear Joyce,\nWe of the Woodson Gynecology Group understand that the women you serve are not\nused to getting medical health and may resist coming to us.  We commit to\nproviding a nurse-practitioner highly skilled at welcoming and encouraging a\nrelationship to be the first person your participants meet here.\n\n\nWe are dependent on the school district to support our principals and to stay\nout of their ways. Here is the letter from the Superintendent:\n\n\nDear Mildred,\nWe commit as a condition of School Turnaround to not introduce any new programs\nto Frowein Elementary School this year without your agreement and to release\nPrincipal Marvin from district meetings and programs that would directly\ninterfere with his participation in School Turnaround.  We understand that our\nkeeping this pledge is a condition of your warranty for school success.\n-->",
