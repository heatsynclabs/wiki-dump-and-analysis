You must have a waiver filled out to use tools at HeatSync Labs. other than that you don't require any special classes or training if you already know how to use them you can do so. If you need to learn how to use a tool then come out during Arduino Night\n\n'''Events:''' Arduino Night is the 1st Wednesday of every month between 7pm - 10pm. No experience necessary.\n\n'''Supplies:''' Yes you can use the general component supplies, please contribute back by helping restock things that are running low.'''\n\n'''Station Champions:''' David Flores, Nate Caine\n\n== Test Equipment ==\n===HP 8116A 50MHz Programmable Pulse Function Generator ===\n\n[[File:HP8116.jpg]]\n\n[[File:8116A_50MHz_Programmable_Pulse_Function_Generator_Manual.pdf‎ ]]\n\n===Rigol Digital Oscilloscope===\nmodel number\nimage\nmanual\n\n===Tektronix Analog Oscilloscope===\nmodel number\nimage\nmanual\n\n===Tektronix Modular 500-Series===\n====DMM-501====\n====PS-201====\n====PG-101====\n\n== Soldering Station ==\n[[http://mightyohm.com/soldercomic good intro to soldering]] for those who are new.\n\n=== Metcal ===\n\n=== Weller ===\n\n=== Hakko===\n\n=== Hot Air Station===\n\n==Microcontrollers==\nThe various microcontrollers are here for you to use to test out ideas.
