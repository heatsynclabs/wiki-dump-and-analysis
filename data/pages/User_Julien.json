The capacitor is placed on this connection. The idea is that if I turned from dim green to bright white, the power supply might be slow to adjust and the NodeMCU might reset (lose power). But with the capacitor, this one will \"discharge\", providing power to the NodeMCU while the power supply adjust. Thanks David for the tip!\n** feeds the LED Strip\nIn theory, I would need a maximum of 4.5A=75led * 0.06A (60mA) for the strips, that's the theoretical maximum for full-brightness white. But I didn't have one handy, so I'll probably set WLED to use max 3.5A, I believe that'll give enough brightness and it leaves 0.5A for my NodeMCU which I believe is enough.\n\n'''What I learned:'''\n\n* everything above :-) Soldering was.. difficult. Everything seems very small haha.\n\n== Certifications ==\n\n2023-09-01: Laser cutting certification by Eric\n\n\n== Templates ==\n\n=== Project ===\n\n  ==== Name ====\n  \n  <nowiki>'''Started:''' 2022-12-31</nowiki>\n  \n  <nowiki>'''Ended:''' current</nowiki>\n  \n  <nowiki>'''Materials:'''</nowiki>\n  \n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  \n  <nowiki>'''Detail:'''</nowiki>\n  \n  * give\n  * some\n  * details\n  ** sublist\n  \n  <nowiki>'''What I learned:'''</nowiki>\n  \n  * list",
