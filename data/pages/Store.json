Get it straight from the lab!\n<h2>Arduino Uno: $35</h2>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1161 alignright\" title=\"arduino-uno\" src=\"http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/arduino-uno.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"149\" />\n\nArduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.\n\nArduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the <a href=\"http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage\">Arduino programming language</a> (based on <a href=\"http://wiring.org.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiring</a>) and the Arduino development environment (based on <a href=\"http://www.processing.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Processing</a>). Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software on running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).\n\n[wp_cart:Arduino Uno:price:40.00:end]\n<h2>Pebble Kit: $35</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/pebble-assembled-top_small/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1270\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1270\" title=\"Pebble-assembled-top_small\" src=\"http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Pebble-assembled-top_small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"156\" /></a>Great kit for beginner to intermediate soldering. The Pebble is an Arduino shield that provides you with some interesting, common I/O devices, such as a temperature sensor, LDR, potentiometer, pushbuttons and a space for an LCD display (LCD sold separately), all nicely integrated onto a PCB, to easily let you get started experimenting with Arduino programs. See the <a href=\"http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Pebble\" target=\"_blank\">HeatSync Labs Wiki article on the Pebble</a> for more info. <strong>Does not include LCD screen, sold separately below.</strong>\n\n[wp_cart:Pebble Kit:price:35.00:end]\n<h2>Pebble (Board Only): $5</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.heatsynclabs.org/store/img_20110129_025802_small/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1258\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1258\" title=\"IMG_20110129_025802_small\" src=\"http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_20110129_025802_small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"126\" /></a>Just the circuit board for the Pebble, no components.

When you're done you get a playable \"Simon Says\" game that lights up and makes sound, plus the kit is actually an Arduino so you can buy a USB FTDI adapter and reprogram it using the Arduino program as if it were a \"Lilypad Arduino w/ ATmega328.\"\n\n[wp_cart:Simon Kit:price:30.00:end]\n<h2>USB FTDI Adapter: $20</h2>\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1177\" title=\"ftdi-small\" src=\"http://www.heatsynclabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ftdi-small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"188\" height=\"188\" />\n\nAllows you to connect to an Arduino or similar microcontroller via USB, when the Arduino doesn't have its own USB port (i.e. the Simon kit and other Arduino clones.)\n\nRequires a USB Mini-B cable not included.\n\n<h2>Hookup Wires</h2>\n.25 each\n\n<h2>flux bottle, full</h2>\n\n<h2>flux bott refill</h2>",
