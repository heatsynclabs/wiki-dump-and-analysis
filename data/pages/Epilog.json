That costs a lot of money, and we can do better with opensauce!\n\nTo install a linux driver you can print to, follow the directions at [http://www.as220.org/labs/wiki/index.php/Laser_Cutter_Technical_Info_Links this wiki page].  The git repo on that page isnt working, pull the cups-epilog.c from [http://aaisp.net.uk/kb-other-free.html] and use that.",
