    "text": "This is a brainstorm done on needs and costs for our 3ry financial report due to the IRS for our 501c3 tax exemption.\n\nNote these costs are set to be high to allow for buying them outside if needed.  It is hoped much of this can be scavenged and made do with but we need realistic operational numbers.\n\nThis list is currently sorted by who came up with them, not by role necessarily.  These needs to be cleaned up and broken down into tables of costs that can be tabulated into larger costs - IE General Supplied, Capital Purchases, etc.  A start will be researching the individual items that are more difficult to put prices on.\n\nChampions needs:\n*people - ?\n*consistent image\n*business cards - \n*web redesign- \n*1page color - worst case scenario .13 a copy kinks - from zach 5cents?\n*logo - 100\n*education\n*joining organizations - ieee table, \n*insurance -D & O az covers??\n\n\nContent Editor needs:\n*UAT/ASU Senior\n*commission video editing/filming\n*swag budget (plastic, tshirt)\n\n\nScribe needs:\n*PO box\n*statutory agent?\n*general supplies 25 a month?\n**plastic storage container\n**document storage       \n\n\nIT needs:\n*sever hosting - \n*multi site licenses - lets just stick to operations? windows 50 a seat\n*servers, ups, desktops? - dell 2000 a year inside space\n*voip phones -  20-30 a month\n*internet-200 for cox, or 4-600 a month for copper\n*wire crimpers ends - fry  100\n\n250-850 recurring costs (internet telephone).
