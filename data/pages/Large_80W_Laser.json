    "text": "=Overview=\nThis is the quick guide for the '''Large 80W Laser Cutter'''. See the [[Laser_Cutters | Laser Cutters]] page for more laser cutter information. For an even briefer guide see the [[Large_80W_Laser_Cheat_Sheet | Cheat Sheet]].\n\n==Size==\nThe cutting area is 1199mm x 769mm.\n\nThe largest material that will fit in the laser is 48\"(w) x 32\"(d).\n\n''Material longer than 32\" can extend thru the rear door flap, but the material will be too high and hit the cone of the laser.''\n\n== What you can cut ==\nThese lists are not exhaustive. If your material is not on either list, ask first! \n\n* See the [[Laser Material Guidelines]] for a list of materials and common speed and power settings.\n\n== Operation ==\n\n=== Turn on the laser ===\n# Turn on the machine\n## Turn on the switch\n## be sure to disengage the E-STOP\n## Verify the following are up and running\n### Laser Cutter\n### Chiller\n### Exhaust fan\n### Air compressor\n\n=== Start the software ===\n# Start the [[LaserCut 5.3]]\n## Communication Problem?\n### Click download to regain communication\n### Save work\n### Exit LaserCut\n### Restart LaserCut\n## “SoftDog” dongle errors\n### These are usually random\n### retry\n\n=== Load your files ===\n# Create your design\n## For more detailed discussion, checkout [[Inkscape]]\n# Shapes, Text, Graphics\n## Use [[LaserCut 5.3]] for simple work, or\n## Import from Adobe Illustrator, [[Inkscape]], Corel, AutoCad, etc\n### Note that LaserCut can't handle SVG files, you'll need DXF instead.\n### In Inkscape you can use the \"Save As...\" menu (but not the \"Export\" menu!) to save as DXF.\n# Assign objects to layers then values for:\n## Speed (consult the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BpAYtyFIKQ4UoXv31mKC43YFxfBk34d_q-muw1SP2aU/edit?usp=sharing laser log] to find good values for your material)\n## Power (consult the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BpAYtyFIKQ4UoXv31mKC43YFxfBk34d_q-muw1SP2aU/edit?usp=sharing laser log] to find good values for your material)\n## Frequency\n## Output\n# Set drawing origin (Choose intelligently based on your design)\n# Click Calculate\n# Simulate (this can help you spot problems)\n\n===Prepare the material===\n# Lower the table so that material doesn't hit the laser head\n# Position material in center of bed (use squaring blocks if necessary)\n\n* [[Laser Focus|Focus the laser]]\n\n==== '''If you run the head through the table hit the E-STOP and see [[Laser Cutter Emergency Guidelines]]''' ====\n\n=== Send your design to the laser ===\n# Download the design to the laser cutter\n## Click “Download” then “Download Current”\n## Close the download window\n\n=== Make sure your design fits on your material ===\n# Check design boundary\n## Click \"Run Box\" to outline the extent of your design area without the laser powering on\n### Don't use Clip Box or it will power on the laser\n\nIf the \"Run Box\" doesn't run and the machine gives you a \"Soft Stop\" it means it detected that the box would be outside of the laser area.  \n\n[[Image:9000-soft-stop.jpg |250px]]\n\nThere are a number of things that can cause this:\n*  You have set the origin and the current laser position in such a way that it will run out of table.\n*  There is something in your design that would send the laser way off of where you expect.\n**  The best way to find these is to make sure you run \"Simulate\" out of LaserCut to see what it's trying to do.\n* Gremlins.\n\nOnce you've fixed your problem, or think you have, you can hit ESC on the machine control pad (lower right) and re-upload and try again.\n\n=== Safety ===\n# Remember your [[Laser Cutter Safety Training]]\n## Locate water spray bottle\n## Locate fire extinguisher\n## Most flare-ups will self-extinguish when the laser stops\n## Stay at the laser while it is running. If you must leave, someone else trained must take your place.\n## If you need to suspend your job quickly, raise the hood. Cutting will resume when you lower the hood.\n## Due to software bugs, do not use the Pause or Stop buttons on either the machine or software\n\n=== Fire in the hole! ===\n# Start the Laser\n## Click 'Start'\n## If you must suspend you can open the hood or click 'Start' again.\n## Avoid using \"Stop\" or \"Pause\" if possible.\n\n\n== Finishing ==\n==== Power Down ====\n# Power Down\n## Wait for smoke/fumes to clear\n## Wait for cooldown (<25°C)\n## Turn off the '''Key-Lock''' switch ''(this '''automatically''' turns off attached equipment)''\n# Verify the following have automatically powered down:\n## Laser Cutter\n## Chiller\n## Exhaust Blower ''(exhaust blower remains on if '''either''' laser machine is on)''\n## Air Compressor\n\n==== Clean the Machine ''(with paper towels and alcohol)'' ==== \n# Rails\n# Scraps\n# Drawer\n# Hood\n# Lens Cone ''('''gently!''')''\n\n==== Clean the Work Area ====\n# Computer Desk ''(don't forget your '''Flash-Drive''')''\n# Work Table\n# Work Area\n# Scrap Area\n# Empty Trash\n\n==== Document ====\n# '''Enter''' your project using the [https://forms.gle/ieRTGmS3ipfLVE7Z9 Large 80W Laser FORM]\n# '''View''' projects using the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BpAYtyFIKQ4UoXv31mKC43YFxfBk34d_q-muw1SP2aU/edit?usp=sharing Large 80W Laser RESPONSES]\n\n= Logs =\n* [https://forms.gle/ieRTGmS3ipfLVE7Z9 Large 80W Laser FORM]\n* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BpAYtyFIKQ4UoXv31mKC43YFxfBk34d_q-muw1SP2aU/edit?usp=sharing Large 80W Laser RESPONSES]\n\n== Old logs ==\n\n* Log work to [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ld4T9pDXP6uqZbYmlebe9SxATHcP436kMobnhSQEKPI/viewform form]. \n* Work log [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoBMPvlNCqvldHl5SERwRHVjN09wRHEtODZzd2RXNWc&usp=sharing results]\n* Log any issues.
