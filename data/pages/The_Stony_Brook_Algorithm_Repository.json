The problem taxonomy, implementations, and supporting material are all drawn from my book The Algorithm Design Manual. Since the practical person is more often looking for a program than an algorithm, we provide pointers to solid implementations of useful algorithms, when they are available.'\n\nGreat resource!\n\n[http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/ The Stony Brook Algorithm Repository]\n\n\n[[Category:Programming Tutorials]]",
