There should be a limit to the number of lines in a given file.\n* function size: fit on a screen.\n* document / doxygen is it.\n* let the compiler find problems:\n** typing\n** avoid setting default values, have the compiler tell you when a garbage value might get used (this is a defect)\n** avoid default in switches\n* if/else -- smaller goes near the test",
