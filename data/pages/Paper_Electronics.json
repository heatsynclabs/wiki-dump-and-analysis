I buy them in bulk from Ebay for a good bit cheaper, but the shipping takes a bit longer that way).\n*[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CR2032/P189-ND/31939 3 volt \"coin cell\" batteries], or anywhere that sells batteries (Radioshack, Walgreens,...), or Ebay.\n+\n*cardstock\n*small binder clips\n*clear scotch tape\n\nIn general, when you search online for electronic components, \"surface mount\" (or SMT) components are small and flat and great for electronic papercraft.\n\nJie Qi (who taught me most of this :) is currently working on \"circuit stickers\" to make it easier to attach the tiny components to paper and copper tape, here's the [http://www.crowdsupply.com/chibitronics/circuit-stickers Crowd Supply link for pre-orders]\nAnd here's a [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/electroninks/circuit-scribe-draw-circuits-instantly Kickstarter for a pen that draws with conductive ink]\n\nMaterials for programmable paper circuits:\n*[http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/ATTINY85V-10PU/ATTINY85V-10PU-ND/735471?cur=USD ATTiny microcontroller]\n*[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11460 TinyAVR programmer]\n*[http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1695 Programming an ATTiny with Arduino]\n\nTutorials and websites (note: the high-low tech (hlt.media.mit.edu) site has occasionally been down recently, but it's a great resource so if it is, check back later!\n*[http://web.media.mit.edu/~jieqi/ Paper-based Electronics]\n*[http://web.media.mit.edu/~jieqi/?p=50 Paper battery holder tutorial, including PDF]\n\nHigh-Low Tech Group at MIT: \n[http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?cat=20 Tutorials]\nSome cool paper-electronics related tutorials in this link include [http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1414 LED dragon kites], [http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1448 electronic origami flapping crane], [http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1376 painted circuits].\n*[http://web.media.mit.edu/~plusea/ Kit-of-no-parts] great starting point if you want to experiment with diverse materials \n\nOther interesting materials:\n*[http://thefiberopticstore.com/purchase/endglowfilament.htm fiber optic cable] \n*[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11594 fiber optic fabric]\n*[http://www.bareconductive.com/ graphite paint](slightly more resistive/less conductive, which is great for making sensors): Bare Paint (they also have some cool paper circuit tutorials, like the little houses and capacitive sensing): \n*[http://www.lessemf.com/paint.html copper paint (Cu-pro Cote paint)]\n*[http://www.conductivecompounds.com/WB_101_Water_Based_Silver_Conductive_Ink.html silver ink]\n*[http://lessemf.com/fabric.html conductive fabric tape] (scroll down to Ni/Cu/Co Fabric tape), good for making folds that won't break over time, but tricky to solder to:\n*[http://www.scientificsonline.com/thermal-liquid-crystal-paints.html /liquid crystal color-changing paint]\n*[http://www.paintwithpearl.com/colorchangestore.htm thermochromic (changes color with heat) pigment powder] \n\nInspirational examples:\n*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI-6wMlaVTc Electronic Popables by Jie Qi]\n*[http://technolojie.com/pu-gong-ying-tu-dandelion-painting/ Pu Gong Ying Tu] \n*[http://www.nataliefreed.com/telescrapbook/ Telescrapbook by Natalie Freed, Jie Qi, and Adam Setapen]\n*[http://web.media.mit.edu/~marcelo/paper/index.html Pulp-based Computing by Marcelo Coehlo]\n*[http://rhizome.org/editorial/3685/ Fold Loud by JooYoun Paek]: Here's the [http://vimeo.com/2059708 video that wasn't in my presentation] \n*[http://metamo.sfc.keio.ac.jp/project/anabiosis/ Anabiosis: color-changing butterflies by Akira Wakita Lab (video)]\n*[http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1372 Paper speakers by Hannah Perner-wilson]\n\nA few electronic textiles/sewable electronics materials and resources (definitely not comprehensive, but because a few people asked about it):\n*[http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=BA2032SM-ND sewable battery holders]\n*[https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=conductive+thread&what=products conductive thread]\n*[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10056 conductive fabric]\n\nSewable microcontrollers, sensors, and other components: \n*[https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/135 LilyPad Arduino] \n*[http://www.adafruit.com/products/659 Flora]\nTutorials: \n*[http://lilypadarduino.org/ LilyPad]\n*[http://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/ Flora]",
