Probably could use some updates, but all the information is still there now, just on one page. - Robert Andrews\n\nRobert, Yeah I saw that. The events page effort is great! I'll go in and fine tune that page. Much can be reduced. - Eric Ose\n\nDoes there need to be a separate Operational Policies page or can that be included in the rules page? The pages Procedures and Processes seem similar in name, but processes seems completely different in purpose. --[[User:Robert Andrews|Robert Andrews]] ([[User talk:Robert Andrews|talk]]) 23:51, 7 February 2024 (MST)\n\nHmm... yeah it looks like [[Category:Tutorials]] and [[Processes]] are similar in purpose. Not getting much use more recently. I'll think about Rules and Operational policies. --[[User:Eric Ose|Eric Ose]] ([[User talk:Eric Ose|talk]]) 15:15, 8 February 2024 (MST)",
