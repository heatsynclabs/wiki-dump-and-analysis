    "text": "==Overview==\n\nThe idea is to make that impossibly small radio that fits inside your ear. Here is a breakdown of how it could work:\n\n*Your cell phone is the transmitter/receiver. This sits in your pocket connected to whomever you wish to talk to.\n*The phone connects via bluetooth or a headset wire to an induction transmitter that is worn around your neck.\n*The necklace is actually a wire loop that acts as an antenna coil.\n*In your ear is an earpiece with an induction receiver than can pick up the transmission from the transmitter.\n*The microphone you speak into is clipped to the inside of your shirt.\n\n\n==Receiver==\n*http://www.techlib.com/electronics/induction.html\n**Contains info about building an induction receiver.\n**Hearing aids contain a telecoil that works as an induction receiver.",
