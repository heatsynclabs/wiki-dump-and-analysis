It's for creative, resourceful people of all ages and backgrounds who like to tinker and love to make things. So much to see, you will need 2 days to see it all!\"\n\nCheck out their home page at:\n\nhttp://www.makerfaire.com/\n\n==Budget==\n\nThis is not going to be a commercial event for us.  We would have had to pay $300 to sell things at our table.\n\n==Provided By Venue==\n\n*'''Tickets:''' As appreciation for your efforts, each maker exhibit will receive '''two (2) complimentary one-day tickets''' at maker check-in. Please note: You will be able to place these tickets at the Main Gate Will Call, if necessary\n\n*'''Special Discount Tickets Available:''' Each exhibiting maker can purchase tickets at $15.00 per ticket (maximum of six). These discounted tickets are available for purchase at maker check-in only.\n\n*'''Indoor Exhibit Area:''' Most of the maker exhibits will be located in the Expo Hall. Your exhibit space will be identified as your assigned area, and you will have the freedom to creatively MAKE your exhibit! The spaces will be subdivided into table top exhibits, 10x10 or 10x20 areas, unless you have stipulated that you need a larger area and/or you will curate your space with an association or a group of makers.  We have a 10x10 area.\n\n*'''Signage:''' We will fabricate a sign for your exhibit area and a page on our website. Each sign includes a short bio, image, and project description based on the project proposal you submitted to the Maker Faire website.\n\n*'''Internet Connectivity:''' Wireless service will be provided in two buildings: Expo Hall and Fiesta. If your project could interfere with our wireless service, please let us know so we can accommodate you and your Faire neighbors. In most cases, a hardwire connection will not be available.\n\n*'''Electricity:''' 120V-5A.  If you provide details of your power requirements, we will make certain you have power available at your exhibit area. Please bring your own surge protectors and/or power strips for power distribution at your exhibit. On-site power requests cannot be guaranteed. Any excessive power will require approval. \n\n*'''Tables and Chairs:''' We will provide two tables(8ft x 30in) and two chairs if you selected a standard set-up. We appreciate makers bringing any other equipment needed to support their exhibit. Additional tables can be ordered; however, a $10.00 per table cost will be incurred. Additional chairs are no charge, but based on availability.\n\n==What To Bring==\n\n*Rep Rap\n*Buttons\n*HSL Signs\n*One Page -- how many to print? color? b/w? If b/w -- Drea can print at home/work.
