I think these designs would be very easy to knock off, and should work fairly well. I would probably extend the belt sander collector to get a bit closer to the belt, to concentrate the airflow a bit more.\n\n[[Media:sander-belt-dust-collector.skp|Click to Download The Belt-Side Sketchup Model File]]\n\n[[File:sander-belt-dust-collector-2.png]]",
