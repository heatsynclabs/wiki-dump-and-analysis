    "text": "==== Public Space ====\n* Public spaces, such as desks, workbenches, floorspace, and tools, must be kept clean when not actively being used.\n** Clean up after yourself as you work in different areas of the space, and don't hog everything! Do a once over before leaving, we don't have a janitor. \n** Leave it cleaner and working better than you found it. Properly maintain any equipment you use, and do not leave equipment in a state where it is likely to be damaged.\n*Do not take equipment out of the lab without consulting the general community. Avoid doing so in general\n*Do not hack apart stuff that isn't yours or a consumable.\n\n==== Tools ====\n* Dangerous tools require certification before you can use them in the lab, even if you have prior experience from outside of Heatsync.\n* Everything in the lab should have a home. Put everything back in it's home so everyone else can find it.\n\n==== Sleeping in the lab ====\n* Sleeping in the lab is only acceptable for 2 nights per week or less.\n\n==== Card Access ====\n* Basic Members can receive cards when approved by a majority vote of members who already have card access[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/heatsynclabs/g9kfaaPkFpI] at [[Hack_Your_Hackerspace | Hack your Hackerspace night]]. You may request someone else propose you get a card, or simply wait until someone proposes that you get a card. Proposing yourself for card access is not permitted.",
