We have some machines in house, but what matters is total cost of ownership.\n\nNetwork Reliability: On-site we do not have multiple redundant high availability lines.\n\nHardware Failure: Hardware failure is a bit more likely with our own gear, and with a cloud provider it *may* magically get fixed for us.\n\nHardware Obsolescence: When the hardware can no longer keep up with the latest version of the server daemon, it has to be replaced. This is the same with on-prem or cloud.\n\nOS Updates: Patching the same version of the OS may come in three flavors: On-Prem and Cloud VPS work the same; sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y. A third option is SaaS or containerized, there may be a hosted wiki option where we don't have to maintain the OS.\n\nOS Upgrades: Again, this works the same for On-Prem or Cloud VPS, but may be easier with SaaS or containerized. For Debian; change the apt sources, sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y, then pray the machine boots as far as SSH so you can fix anything that went sideways during the upgrade. SaaS / containerized may let you get off easier.\n\nOpen question: In which, if any, of these cases would we not have to:\n# Install the latest version of MediaWiki\n# Apply our MediaWiki configuration\n# Pull the latest database dump\n# Load the dump into the new database\n# Set up nightly backup",
