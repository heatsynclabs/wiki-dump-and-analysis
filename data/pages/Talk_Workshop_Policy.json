(Eric Ose)\n\nThis document presents itself as a policy, but I find no proposals to make it a policy. Perhaps we should rename this workshop process, or event/workshop process.\n\nEither way I'll be re-writing this to conform to our current practice.\n\nThere was reference to a volunteer that would do both marketing including social media, volunteer coordination, cleaning. I removed that entirely as no such position is or will exist as it would be too demanding.",
