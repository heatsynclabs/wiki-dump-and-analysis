    "text": "==Overview==\nIn an effort to get new volunteers we set up a [https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1230558.jsp VolunteerMatch]] page for HeatSync Labs. The project is on hiatus and I'm not sure if I'm the right person to lead this.\n\n==General Notes==\nWhile I did meet a lot of great people and we had people help out for a bit I struggled with keeping people engaged. I suspect that people want clear goals and since things are very flexible at the lab it can be confusing. Also during that time were having a lot of trouble getting people attending our events. Probably less motivating to try and help when there wasn't as much happening.\n\nA big part of my motivation to do this was in hopes of finding ways to reduce my overall workload. It ended up being more work trying to manage people.\n\nThe biggest success was finding Saketh who hosted Roblox game programming classes. HeatSync hasn't had any programming classes, let alone video game programming classes in a very long time. It was a huge thing to have this and was not well attended.\n\n==Past Postings==\n*Bicycle tune-up / repair instructor\n*Fix It Day Host\n*Help document making things at our makerspace\n*LEGO Day Co-Host\n*Help with a maker event for beginners\n*Become a maker by being around people making things (Co-Hosting)\n*Teach painting and host art meetups\n*Tech Tear Apart Setup \n\n[[Category:Project]]",
