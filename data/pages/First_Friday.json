From the event organizers website they describe it as:\n\n'''\"Tour more than 70 galleries, venues and art-related spaces to see a variety of artwork and to enjoy the spirit and culture of the city as you mingle with thousands of other residents and visitors.\"'''\n\nFind out more about First Friday and their host Artlink Phoenix at the below link:\n\nhttp://www.artlinkphoenix.com/about/\n\nI hope for this page to be an accumulation of project ideas we would like to bring to the event, costs of reserving a table at the event, and general contact information that we would need to get things ready for the event.\n\n==Items to Bring==\n\n[[Image:hsl-ff.jpg|right|400px]]\n\n*Tent\n*Hanging Lights\n*Tables\n*Gas Generator - 3000W or Greater\n*Business Cards\n*One Page Flyers\n*T-Shirts\n*Make Magazines\n*Buttons\n*Balloons\n*Extension Cords\n*Water(It's hot and we're there for 5-6 hours!)\n*HSL Signs\n\n==Costs==\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|'''Item'''\n|'''Cost'''\n|'''Notes'''\n|-\n|10' by 10' Space\n|Pre-Register: $50 or Same Day: $100\n|\n|-\n|Corner Space\n|Additional $20\n|\n|-\n|Gas Generator Use\n|Additional $20\n|Have to be placed in special zone\n|-\n|Retail Vendors\n|Additional $20\n|\n|-\n|Rent Gas Generator\n|$35 for a Night\n|Home Depot - Bring Back Next Morning\n|-\n|Helium - 20 cu ft.\n|$16 for a week\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n\n==Contact Info==\n\n'''Hillary:'''  602 475 2661\n\n==Event Information Files==\n\nEvent Map:<br>\n[[Media:Mar_Map.pdf|Mar_Map.pdf]]\n\nEvent Application:<br>\n[[Media:PhoestivalVendorApp_FINAL.pdf|PhoestivalVendorApp_FINAL.pdf]]\n\n==Event Notes==\n\n*This may not be the venue for selling or swag as no one was remotely interested(given we didn't really try to sell).\n*We need to find out if First Friday will be continuing through out the summer.\n*Total came to around $100 for a table with no revenue but heavy face time with people.  Can we achieve the same face time by walking around as mad scientists with our inventions?\n*Focus on maker went well.  Would be nice to keep that if we continue with the table format.\n*We could really use a banner(vinyl?) or something to stand out more.",
