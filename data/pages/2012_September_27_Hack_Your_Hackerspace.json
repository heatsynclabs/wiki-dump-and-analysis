    "text": "'''Voting members present:''' 14\n\n\n'''Proposal: Purchase CNC Mill'''\nProposer: Ben Humphreys\n\nI propose that HeatSync Labs:\nPurchase the CNC Mill from Joseph Julicher for the price of $1500, with the money donated specifically for that purpose, with the difference being made up with money from the general budget.\nEstablish a fund dedicated to CNC related expenses. CNC-specific donatings will go into this fund, along with a portion of the certification class fees, and the contents of a tip jar to be setup next to the machine.\nI don't know how much money is earmarked for CNC right now. But there have been $610 of pledges in the earlier syncstarter thread, so assuming everyone put in that much and no more, that leaves $890 to come from the general funds.\n\n'''ACTION:''' 0/8 Motion fails\n\n'''NOTES:'''\nCNC mill purchase \n$1500 total\n$890 from general funds\nNate wants to get more information. How much has been donated? Do we have enough in the budget?\n\n'''Proposal: Board members voted onto board, not voted into positions'''\nProposer: Chad Stearns\n\nBoard elections are a simple vote between \"On the board\" or \"Not on the board\" for any given candidate running to be on the board.\n\nOnce the board is determined, the board members self-organize into their duties.\n\nThis is in contrast with how things are currently done, where candidates are voted into positions, like treasurer or champion etc. Instead, my proposal suggests candidates run to be on the board, and a candidate having a particular responsibility is something the board themselves agree on.\n\n'''ACTION:''' 4/7 Motion fails\n\n'''Proposal: Table any changes to the Bylaws or Board seats''' \nProposer: Jerry Davis\nI believe that we should not change anything until AFTER we vote on\nofficers in October.\n\n'''ACTION:''' 3/6 Motion fails\n\n'''Proposal: Keycard Zach Priddy'''\n\n'''ACTION:''' 8/1 Motion passes\n\n'''Proposal: Keycard Jennifer Plamondon''' \n\n'''ACTION:''' 14/0 Motion passes\n\n'''Proposal: Tshirt Re-supply'''\nProposer: Will\n\nPropose to spend ~$95 to restock the following sizes:\nBlack Extra Large with tax = ($8.72 ea)\nBlack 2XL with tax = ($10.90 ea)\nBlack 3XL with tax = ($11.99 ea)\nBlack 4XL Tall with tax = ($17.99 ea)\n\nShirts are sold at $20ea regardless of size; do the math, that's our profit per shirt.\n\n6xl\n1 womens xl\n1 2xl\n1 3xl\n1 4xl\n\n\n'''ACTION:'''T-shirt resupply 14/0 Motion carries\n'''Notes:'''\nConcerns about price per shirt\nOthers not concerned about profit margin",
