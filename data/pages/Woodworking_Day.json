If anyone wants to take this on then step up and post to the discussion group.\n\n== Event Description ==\n\nLet's get the woodworking tools set up out back and make use of them.\n\nBring your projects or just your curiosity. This event is open to everyone interested in woodworking.\n\nCome out if you want to use or learn more about a specific woodworking tool. See our list of [[WoodShop#Tools | wood shop tools.]]\n\nSome tools require a checkout process or class to use them on your own. This will be a good time to get checked out on most of the woodworking tools. The table saw and router will require a full safety certification before you use them on your own.\n\nI am currently looking for volunteers with woodworking experience to help host woodworking day on a monthly bases. If you or someone you know may be interested please reach out. See this [https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp3763191.jsp volunteermatch page] with more info.\n\n[[Category:Events]][[Category:WoodShop]]",
