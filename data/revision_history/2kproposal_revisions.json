      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\n[[image:Blood_sweat_tears.jpg | thumb]]\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age.   Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional institutions are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. In addition to these resources, it is also important to us that we provide a physical communal space, the value of which can be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nThe Phoenix area is full of technology companies whose numerous engineers need an independent, creative avenue. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design, and there are legal issues to using company resources. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market.\nOur public schools and university students are in need of quality professional tools. Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs, while at the same time raising tuition prices and enrollment and laboratory fees.\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. The popularity of the TLC Network, scheduled predominantly with Do-It-Yourself (DIY) programming, and CRAFT magazine, a project-based publication devoted entirely to DIY crafts, attests to this burgeoning enthusiasm.The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles,' is one example of a new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with lighted turn signals sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable. A perfect place to experience this culture is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. \n\nHeatSync Labs will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space and the development of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the maker press space including MAKE magazine's blog coverage of us in their August 12, 2009, post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona, and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have recently been approved and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption. Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to accept industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. Even with the assistance of a local real estate agent, we realize the enormity of this undertaking.  As a result, we are looking to continue community relationships such as our current agreement with the Mesa Fraternity of Police to use their facilities for our meetings. A necessity for a venture of this nature is liability insurance.  Early research shows the rates to be surprisingly reasonable at $2000-$4000 annually for $2 million in coverage. \nMonthly dues are going to be crucial, which means marketing for growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference. A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. It can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts, and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The RepRap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper), invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts. The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words:\n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only be an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool supporting future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community-driven model has been successfully implemented around the country and the world under the mantle 'hackerspace,' a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the community tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of similar, and most importantly, unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture targeted mainly at startups, has created a similar, but commercial, space with a $125 monthly charge. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler, Arizona, with four resident companies and free co-workspace for private individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model. Fortunately, Phoenix is a growing growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the U.S., with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\n[[image:Reprap_mendel.jpg | thumb]]\n\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is cyclical in nature. Without tools and a space, potential donors may be hesitant to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly dues. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy, then, must address this issue, and the RepRap is the solution to the problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, initiates our outreach plans. The RepRap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the RepRap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest RepRap. To this end, the RepRap team maintains a list of its machines around the globe. As of this writing our RepRap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the mother of all future RepRaps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest RepRap and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other art communities in order to educate by conducting talks and workshops. By taking the RepRap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the RepRap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, visual, and tactile manner. It is the promise of the future!\n\n==Economic/Social/Cultural Impact==\nOur goal is community outreach, not just to offer service, but to survive and flourish! As previously described, we believe the only way to maintain and indeed grow the non-profit will be through helping the community achieve. We intend to be a driving force in creating interest, especially in younger students, in the fields of engineering, science, and the arts. We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry-leading tools in combination with an open, engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to encourage a return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for and with our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new. We aim to instill the mindset of learning by both dissecting existing technology and collaboratively constructing the products of our imaginations.\n\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again. Amongst our group you'll find, for example, professional engineers, seamstresses, musicians, and students.\n\n[[File:andrea.jpg|thumb]]\n'''*Andrea Young - Executive Director'''\n:Andrea Young is a founding member of HeatSync Labs.

Even with the assistance of a local real estate agent, we realize the enormity of this undertaking.  As a result, we are looking to continue community relationships such as our current agreement with the Mesa Fraternity of Police to use their facilities for our meetings. A necessity for a venture of this nature is liability insurance.  Early research shows the rates to be surprisingly reasonable at $2000-$4000 annually for $2 million in coverage. \nMonthly dues are going to be crucial, which means marketing for growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference. A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. It can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts, and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The RepRap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper), invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts. The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words:\n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only be an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool supporting future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community-driven model has been successfully implemented around the country and the world under the mantle 'hackerspace,' a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the community tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of similar, and most importantly, unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture targeted mainly at startups, has created a similar, but commercial, space with a $125 monthly charge. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler, Arizona, with four resident companies and free co-workspace for private individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model. Fortunately, Phoenix is a growing growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the U.S., with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\n[[image:Reprap_mendel.jpg | thumb]]\n\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is cyclical in nature. Without tools and a space, potential donors may be hesitant to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly dues. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy, then, must address this issue, and the RepRap is the solution to the problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, initiates our outreach plans. The RepRap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the RepRap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest RepRap. To this end, the RepRap team maintains a list of its machines around the globe. As of this writing our RepRap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the mother of all future RepRaps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest RepRap and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other art communities in order to educate by conducting talks and workshops. By taking the RepRap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the RepRap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, visual, and tactile manner. It is the promise of the future!\n\n==Economic/Social/Cultural Impact==\nOur goal is community outreach, not just to offer service, but to survive and flourish! As previously described, we believe the only way to maintain and indeed grow the non-profit will be through helping the community achieve. We intend to be a driving force in creating interest, especially in younger students, in the fields of engineering, science, and the arts. We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry-leading tools in combination with an open, engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to encourage a return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for and with our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new. We aim to instill the mindset of learning by both dissecting existing technology and collaboratively constructing the products of our imaginations.\n\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again. Amongst our group you'll find, for example, professional engineers, seamstresses, musicians, and students.\n\n[[File:andrea.jpg|thumb]]\n'''*Andrea Young - Executive Director'''\n:Andrea Young is a founding member of HeatSync Labs.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age.   Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional institutions are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. In addition to these resources, it is also important to us that we provide a physical communal space, the value of which can be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nThe Phoenix area is full of technology companies whose numerous engineers need an independent, creative avenue. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design, and there are legal issues to using company resources. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market.\nOur public schools and university students are in need of quality professional tools. Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs, while at the same time raising tuition prices and enrollment and laboratory fees.\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. The popularity of the TLC Network, scheduled predominantly with Do-It-Yourself (DIY) programming, and CRAFT magazine, a project-based publication devoted entirely to DIY crafts, attests to this burgeoning enthusiasm.The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles,' is one example of a new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with lighted turn signals sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable. A perfect place to experience this culture is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. \n\nHeatSync Labs will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space and the development of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the maker press space including MAKE magazine's blog coverage of us in their August 12, 2009, post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona, and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have recently been approved and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption. Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to accept industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate.

We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry-leading tools in combination with an open, engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to encourage a return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for and with our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new. We aim to instill the mindset of learning by both dissecting existing technology and collaboratively constructing the products of our imaginations.\n\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age.   Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional institutions are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. In addition to these resources, it is also important to us that we provide a physical communal space, the value of which can be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nThe Phoenix area is full of technology companies whose numerous engineers need an independent, creative avenue. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design, and there are legal issues to using company resources. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market.\nOur public schools and university students are in need of quality professional tools. Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs, while at the same time raising tuition prices and enrollment and laboratory fees.\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. The popularity of the TLC Network, scheduled predominantly with Do-It-Yourself (DIY) programming, and CRAFT magazine, a project-based publication devoted entirely to DIY crafts, attests to this burgeoning enthusiasm.The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles,' is one example of a new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with lighted turn signals sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable. A perfect place to experience this culture is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. \n\nHeatSync Labs will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space and the development of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the maker press space including MAKE magazine's blog coverage of us in their August 12, 2009, post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona, and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have recently been approved and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption. Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to accept industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. Even with the assistance of a local real estate agent, we realize the enormity of this undertaking.  As a result, we are looking to continue community relationships such as our current agreement with the Mesa Fraternity of Police to use their facilities for our meetings. A necessity for a venture of this nature is liability insurance.  Early research shows the rates to be surprisingly reasonable at $2000-$4000 annually for $2 million in coverage. \nMonthly dues are going to be crucial, which means marketing for growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference. A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. It can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts, and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The RepRap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper), invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts. The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words:\n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only be an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool supporting future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community-driven model has been successfully implemented around the country and the world under the mantle 'hackerspace,' a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the community tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of similar, and most importantly, unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture targeted mainly at startups, has created a similar, but commercial, space with a $125 monthly charge. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler, Arizona, with four resident companies and free co-workspace for private individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model. Fortunately, Phoenix is a growing growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the U.S., with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is cyclical in nature. Without tools and a space, potential donors may be hesitant to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly dues. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy, then, must address this issue, and the RepRap is the solution to the problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, initiates our outreach plans. The RepRap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the RepRap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest RepRap. To this end, the RepRap team maintains a list of its machines around the globe. As of this writing our RepRap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the mother of all future RepRaps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest RepRap and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other art communities in order to educate by conducting talks and workshops. By taking the RepRap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the RepRap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, visual, and tactile manner. It is the promise of the future!\n\n==Economic/Social/Cultural Impact==\nOur goal is community outreach, not just to offer service, but to survive and flourish!

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies, and therefore engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. \n\nOur public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targeted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again.

Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targeted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again. Amongst our group you'll find, for example, professional engineers, seamstresses, musicians, and students. \n\n[[File:andrea.jpg|thumb]]\n*Andrea Young - Andrea Young is a founding member of HeatSync Labs, the only hackerspace in the Phoenix-Metro area.

We intend to be a driving force in creating interest, especially in younger students, in the fields of engineering and science.  We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry leading tools in combination with an open engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to encourage a return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new ones.  We aim to instill the mindset of learning by both dissecting existing technology and collaboratively constructing the products of our imaginations.",

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype.

There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again. Amongst our group you'll find, for example, professional engineers, seamstresses, musicians, and students. \n\n[[File:andrea.jpg|thumb]]\n*Andrea Young - Andrea Young is a founding member of HeatSync Labs, the only hackerspace in the Phoenix-Metro area.

We aim to instill the mindset of learning by both dissecting existing technology and collaboratively constructing the products of our imaginations.",

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies, and therefore engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. \n\nOur public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targeted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies, and therefore engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. \n\nOur public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targeted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.

The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nWe are HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. From YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies, and therefore engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. \n\nOur public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts and create sculpture or scale models. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue.

Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again.

We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry leading tools in combination with an open engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to ride the continued breakdown of the broadcast model and encourage the return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for our neighbors, enriching all of our lives.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies, and therefore engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. \n\nOur public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts and create sculpture or scale models Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's.

A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit articles of incorporation have been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take industry donations, collect member dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  A popular technology that has captivated the attention of industry professionals and hobbyists alike, is the 3D printer, which enables you to print a computer file representation of a 3D object. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken or unavailable parts and create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies, and therefore engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. \n\nOur public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies, and therefore engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. \n\nOur public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  \n\nEven historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds. HeatSync will provide the outlet for these disparate disciplines. \n\nOver the last three months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his Beautiful Light project shown in both Scottsdale, Arizona and internationally in Toronto, Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again. Amongst our group you'll find, for example, professional engineers, seamstresses, musicians, and students. \n*Andrea Young - Team Lead and founding member of HeatSync\n*David Huerta - David is a graduate of Devry, the DeVry Linux User's Group Founder and current IEEE Phoenix Section's Teacher In-Service committee member where he has experience giving back to the community.\n\n*Jacob Rosenthal - Jacob is a Computer Software Engineer by day and a Computer Systems Engineer by night. \n\n*Paul Hickey – Paul is currently the Systems Administrator of MCC CTL where he is also active on committees for education grants, and has experience as a training coordinator\n*Jeremy Leung – Jeremy is a founding member of HeatSync and a Technician and Trainer at Cave Creek Web Hosting.\n\n==Budget==\n*Bar \t18\n*Bearings \t\t\t51\n*Belt \t\t\t38\n*Extruder parts \t\t\t24\n*Fasteners \t\t\t121\n*Motors \t\t130\n*PCB/Electronics \t\t\t179\n*Thin sheet \t\t\t0\n*RP \t\t\t33\n*Thick sheet \t\t\t33\n*Studding \t\t19\n*PLA\t\t\t14\n*ABS\t\t\t10\n*HDPE\t\t\t7\n*kit fee\t\t\t200\n*shipping\t\t100\n*Exemption filing\t\t750\n*lawyer fees\t\t\t250\n\t\t\t\n*total\t\t\t1977.82\n\n\n==Economic/Social/Cultural Impact==\nOur goal is community outreach, not just to offer service, but to survive and flourish! As previously described, we believe the only way to maintain and indeed grow the non-profit will be through enabling the community to achieve. We intend to be a driving force in creating interest, especially in younger students, in the fields of engineering and science.  We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry leading tools in combination with an open engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to ride the continued breakdown of the broadcast model and encourage the return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new ones.  We seek to plant the seed of possibility in as many minds as possible and see what new creations come forth.",

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at startups. Techshop has expanded slowly into Oregon and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals.

One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in innovation and engineering fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale, and other local manufacturers, which means there is no better place to locate(??).\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap (REPlicating RAPid prototyper) is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.

People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThe hackerspace model is by its nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in (innovation instead of engineering?) and development fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale, and other local manufactures, which means there is no better place to locate(??).\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Reprap is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Reprap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Reprap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Reprap neighbor. To this end, the Reprap team maintains a list of Repraps around the globe. As of this writing our Reprap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Repraps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Reprap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Reprap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Reprap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again.

We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry leading tools in combination with an open engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to ride the continued breakdown of the broadcast model and encourage the return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new ones.  We seek to plant the seed of possibility in as many minds as possible and see what new creations come forth.",

We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry leading tools in combination with an open engaged community of peers.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools, a place to work and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many of our group are Gangplank regulars.\n\nThis model is by its very nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in engineering and development fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale, and other local manufactures, which means there is no better place to locate.\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Rep Rap is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Rep Rap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Rep Rap neighbor. To this end, the Rep Rap team maintains a list of Rep Raps around the globe. As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Rep Raps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Rep Rap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \n\nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Rep Rap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform, which combines inexpensive microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles', is one example of the new blending of technologies producing, for example, a jacket for cyclists with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kinds.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many amongst our group are Gangplank regulars.\nThis model is by its very nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in engineering and development fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale, and other local manufactures, which means there is no better place to locate.\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Rep Rap is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Rep Rap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Rep Rap neighbor. To this end, the Rep Rap team maintains a list of Rep Raps around the globe. As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Rep Raps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Rep Rap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Rep Rap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes.

There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet the creative demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members.\n\n==Current Market Need==\nFor most of the 20th century, American culture has been a publish/broadcast society with people being consumers. Lately, outlets such as Make magazine and Do-It-Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market.  Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype a design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform is an interesting example of the inexpensive convergence of microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles' including, for example, a jacket for bikers with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kind.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals.

Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many amongst our group are Gangplank regulars.\nThis model is by its very nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in engineering and development fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale, and other local manufactures, which means there is no better place to locate.\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Rep Rap is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Rep Rap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Rep Rap neighbor. To this end, the Rep Rap team maintains a list of Rep Raps around the globe. As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Rep Raps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Rep Rap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Rep Rap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet this demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members. \n\n==Current Market Need==\nOutlets such as Make magazine and Do It Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market. For the last several decades, American culture had swung towards a broadcast society. Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype your design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform is an interesting example of the inexpensive convergence of microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles' including, for example, a jacket for bikers with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kind.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models.

A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kind.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to rapidly prototype new inventions, replicate broken and unavailable parts of existing products, create sculpture or scale models. In the Internet age, what company would send a prototype half-way around the world when they could email the description file and produce the part on-site in minutes.  Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace in Chandler with four resident companies and free co-workspace for individuals. Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many amongst our group are Gangplank regulars.\nThis model is by its very nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in engineering and development fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale, and other local manufactures, wich means there is no better place to locate.\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Rep Rap is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Rep Rap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Rep Rap neighbor. To this end, the Rep Rap team maintains a list of Rep Raps around the globe. As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Rep Raps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Rep Rap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Rep Rap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again. Amongst our group you'll find, for example, professional engineers, seamstresses, musicians, and students. \n*Andrea Young - Team Lead and founding member of HeatSync\n*David Huerta - David is a graduate of Devry, the former Devry Linux User's Group President and current IEEE Phoenix Section's Teacher In-Service committee member where he has experience giving back to the community.\n\n*Jacob Rosenthal - Jacob is a Computer Software Engineer by day and a Computer Systems Engineer by night. \n\n*Paul Hickey – Paul is currently the Systems Administrator of MCC CTL where he is also active on committees for education grants, and has experience as a training coordinator\n*Jeremy Leung – Jeremy is a founding member of HeatSync and a Technician and Trainer at Cave Creek Web Hosting.\n\n==Budget==\n*Bar \t18\n*Bearings \t\t\t51\n*Belt \t\t\t38\n*Extruder parts \t\t\t24\n*Fasteners \t\t\t121\n*Motors \t\t130\n*PCB/Electronics \t\t\t179\n*Thin sheet \t\t\t0\n*RP \t\t\t33\n*Thick sheet \t\t\t33\n*Studding \t\t19\n*PLA\t\t\t14\n*ABS\t\t\t10\n*HDPE\t\t\t7\n*kit fee\t\t\t200\n*shipping\t\t100\n*Exemption filing\t\t750\n*lawyer fees\t\t\t250\n\t\t\t\n*total\t\t\t1977.82\n\n\n==Economic/Social/Cultural Impact==\nOur goal is community outreach, not just to offer service, but to survive and flourish!

We intend to be a driving force in creating interest, especially in younger students, in the fields of engineering and science.  We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry leading tools in combination with an open engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to ride the continued breakdown of the broadcast model and encourage the return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new ones.",

      "text": "==HeatSync Labs==\nFrom YouTube™ videos to music to small electronics, the Internet has created an entire generation of users who choose to break free from the traditional broadcast-consume model and instead aspire to create and share. Concurrent with this rise in interest, traditional outlets are becoming less able to provide the resources to meet this demand. While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members. \n\n==Current Market Need==\nOutlets such as Make magazine and Do It Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market. For the last several decades, American culture had swung towards a broadcast society. Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype your design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.

While the cost of digital production has fallen to nearly zero, access to professional quality tools has not followed as quickly. Heavy industrial and electrical equipment, as well as professional computer software packages, can be so costly as to be out of reach for the student, entrepreneur, or garage tinkerer. Enter HeatSync Labs, a non-profit community center for the modern age. Our mission is to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to the community at large, including artists, engineers, and students. It is important to us that the value of the space be found as much in the access to tools as in educating and making connections among members. \n\n==Current Market Need==\nOutlets such as Make magazine and Do It Yourself programming on TV have seen major growth in the transitioning media market. For the last several decades, American culture had swung towards a broadcast society. Since the inception of the Internet, that has changed. People are more and more interested in creating and sharing with the world, whether that be a YouTube™ video, art, or a prototype. The Phoenix area is full of technology companies and, therefore, engineers who need a creative outlet. Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype your design. There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market. Our public schools and college students, too, are in need of quality professional tools.  Institutions are cutting costs by removing arts and industrial programs while at the same time raising tuition prices, and enrollment and laboratory fees.  Even historically non-technically savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture. This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC, which are full of DIY programming.  The Lilypad platform is an interesting example of the inexpensive convergence of microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles' including, for example, a jacket for bikers with a lighted turn signal sewn in. This softening of the electrical engineering field is attracting demographics previously thought to be unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday, a monthly multicultural venue for artists of all kind.  \nHeatSync will provide this outlet for these disparate disciplines. Over the last three Months, HeatSync has been hosting biweekly meetings to discuss the creation of the space, working collaboratively on projects, sharing our skills and demonstrating our individual projects.  At the same time, the digital community has been growing through the creation of our website, wiki, and ToolShare, our social tool sharing site. ToolShare enables users to list the tools they're willing to share, and search for a tool they would like to borrow. This early work has gained us some recognition on the national scale with writeups in the Maker press space including Make magazine's blog covering us in their Aug 12, 2009 post, and our group recently being approached to help the artist D.A. Therrien with his beautiful light project shown in both Arizona and internationally in Canada.\n\n==Steps for a Successful Launch==\nThe non-profit LLC has been submitted and a board of directors is currently being elected. The next step for us is to gain Federal Tax exemption.  Once these legal hurdles are cleared, we will be able to take donations, collect dues, and locate a permanent space for our users to congregate and collaborate. We realize the enormity of this undertaking and we are looking at possible partnerships with local communities to bring the costs down.  Donations and monthly dues are going to be key, which means marketing and growth will be of utmost importance. This is where we believe high profile tools will make the difference.  One majorly sought after technology today is the 3D printer. A 3D printer enables you to create (or download) a computer file representation of a 3D object and then 'print' it right before your eyes. They can be used to prototype new inventions or fix broken parts of existing products. Currently, low-end commercial 3D fabricator machines cost upwards of $20,000. There exists one alternative, however, whose ethos fits nicely in with HeatSync's. The Rep Rap, invented by Dr. Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, is a free-to-download blueprint to create your own 3D printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in the project's own words: \n\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant. Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors? … And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"Citation Needed \n\nProviding such rare and professional-level tools will not only by being an amazing resource to our users, but will also prove to be a powerful marketing tool enabling future growth.\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\nThis community model  has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace', a list of which can be found at http://www.hackerspaces.org. These groups are all unconnected, some of them private, some non-profit, and possibly others for profit. Generally, the model calls for a group of people to pay monthly dues between $50 and $75 in order to join. This, in turn, gives them access to the local tools and opportunities to network with other users of both similar and unrelated disciplines. Techshop (http://techshop.ws/), a California venture, has created a similar commercial space with a  $125 monthly charge targetted mainly at Startups. He has expanded slowly into Portland and North Carolina, but  has yet to reach Phoenix. Gangplank is a workspace here in Tempe, which is open during normal business hours, for what is being termed “co-workspace.” Their main focus is on software development collaboration, and as such they currently do not provide any resources or tools beyond the space itself. Many amongst our group are Gangplank regulars.\nThis model is by its very nature entirely dependent on locality. These groups, where successful, tap into the community to prosper. There are no other spaces, for profit or otherwise, like this in Arizona, let alone Phoenix, and as such there is no direct competitor to our model.  Fortunately Phoenix is a growing municipality, the fifth largest city in the US, with a dominating presence in engineering and development fueled by the surrounding industries such as ASU, Intel, FreeScale, and other local manufactures, wich means there is no better place to locate.\nThe major barrier to market entry is the problem of the chicken or the egg. Without tools and a space, donors may be unwilling to give, and members may be unwilling to pay monthly fees. Without this startup capital, however, it will be very difficult to acquire a space and fill it with tools. Our strategy then must address this issue. The Rep Rap is the solution to the chicken and the egg problem. This first tool, providing tens of thousands of dollars of functionality at a fraction of that cost, will also enable our outreach plans to unfold. The Rep Rap is a high profile device which immediately conveys value and prestige upon our space. Since a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important for prospective and current owners to be able to locate the nearest Rep Rap neighbor. To this end, the Rep Rap team maintains a list of Rep Raps around the globe. As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona. This will allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Rep Raps in this state. It is not unheard of for users to travel hundreds of miles just to see the nearest Rep Rap, and for others to seek them out to begin printing parts to start building their own.  \nWe also intend to reach out to colleges, high schools, and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition by conducting talks and workshops.  By taking the Rep Rap out to schools, First Fridays, and other events, we will be able to gain real mindshare. It can be difficult to describe what exactly HeatSync is, and the Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner. It is a device which can make your dreams come to reality before your eyes. It is, indeed, the promise of the future!\n\n==Project Team==\nWe are a team of artists, engineers, and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing.  Now we want to bring that culture back home again. Amongst our group you'll find, for example, professional engineers, seamstresses, musicians, and students. \n*Andrea Young - Team Lead and founding member of HeatSync\n*David Huerta - David is a graduate of Devry, the former Devry Linux User's Group President and current IEEE Phoenix Section's Teacher In-Service committee member where he has experience giving back to the community.\n\n*Jacob Rosenthal - Jacob is a Computer Software Engineer by day and a Computer Systems Engineer by night. \n\n*Paul Hickey – Paul is currently the Systems Administrator of MCC CTL where he is also active on committees for education grants, and has experience as a training coordinator\n*Jeremy Leung – Jeremy is a founding member of HeatSync and a Technician and Trainer at Cave Creek Web Hosting.\n\n==Budget==\n*Bar \t18\n*Bearings \t\t\t51\n*Belt \t\t\t38\n*Extruder parts \t\t\t24\n*Fasteners \t\t\t121\n*Motors \t\t130\n*PCB/Electronics \t\t\t179\n*Thin sheet \t\t\t0\n*RP \t\t\t33\n*Thick sheet \t\t\t33\n*Studding \t\t19\n*PLA\t\t\t14\n*ABS\t\t\t10\n*HDPE\t\t\t7\n*kit fee\t\t\t200\n*shipping\t\t100\n*Exemption filing\t\t750\n*lawyer fees\t\t\t250\n\t\t\t\n*total\t\t\t1977.82\n\n\n==Economic/Social/Cultural Impact==\nOur goal is community outreach, not just to offer service, but to survive and flourish! As previously described, we believe the only way to maintain and indeed grow the non-profit will be through enabling the community to achieve. We intend to be a driving force in creating interest, especially in younger students, in the fields of engineering and science.  We also want to pick up where school leaves off – providing access to industry leading tools in combination with an open engaged community of peers. Finally, we want to ride the continued breakdown of the broadcast model and encourage the return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new ones.",

Finally, we want to ride the continued breakdown of the broadcast model and encourage the return to “The Commons,” where we create and share for our neighbors, enriching all of our lives. An important component of this is getting away from our “throw-away” culture—to encourage modifying existing products and repairing broken items instead of buying new ones.",

Generally, a collection of people pay monthly dues between $50 and $75 per month in order to join and use the complex's tools and network with its users.  It is free to list yourself on this list which brings about national recognition to the users of these spaces.\n\nTechshop, http://techshop.ws/, does a commercial version by charging $125/month to mainly attract Startups.  His commercial version has yet to reach Phoenix however.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is capital.  Tools and software are extremely expensive and the problem turns into that of the chicken and the egg.  Without tools, users are unwilling to pay monthly fees, and without fees there are no tools.  Donations will help this as all a company necessarily needs to see is your nonprofit tax deductible status.  The space will attempt to partner with any and all technical companies in order to bring in the capital and supplies necessary to bootstrap the business.\n\nWe intend to outreach to colleges and high schools and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition.  It will also be important to do talks and workshops at the location.  This will bring in additional users to continue the subscription model and continue to build our name presence helping us gain new donors.\n\n\nHopefully it is not obvious to the reader, but it can be difficult to describe what exactly Heatsync is.

The Rep Rap(Replicating Rapid-Prototyper) is a free to download blueprint to create your own 3d printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in their own words:\n\n*\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant.  Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors?\"\t\n*\"And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nHere's a great single page write-up about the device:<br>\nhttp://www.reprap.org/pub/Main/WebHome/one-page.pdf\n\n[[File:Escher_Drawing_Hands.gif|400px]]\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\n\n'''Describe the market in which the project will operate and what barriers there are to market entry, if any. Include an overview of potential partners. Explain the project’s outreach plan.'''\n\nThis business plan has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace, a list of which can be found at hackerspaces.org.  These groups are all unconnected with some of them private, some non profit, and possibly others for profit.  Generally, a collection of people pay monthly dues between $50 and $75 per month in order to join and use the complex's tools and network with its users.  It is free to list yourself on this list which brings about national recognition to the users of these spaces.\n\nTechshop, http://techshop.ws/, does a commercial version by charging $125/month to mainly attract Startups.  His commercial version has yet to reach Phoenix however.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is capital.  Tools and software are extremely expensive and the problem turns into that of the chicken and the egg.  Without tools, users are unwilling to pay monthly fees, and without fees there are no tools.  Donations will help this as all a company necessarily needs to see is your nonprofit tax deductible status.  The space will attempt to partner with any and all technical companies in order to bring in the capital and supplies necessary to bootstrap the business.\n\nWe intend to outreach to colleges and high schools and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition.  It will also be important to do talks and workshops at the location.  This will bring in additional users to continue the subscription model and continue to build our name presence helping us gain new donors.\n\n\nHopefully it is not obvious to the reader, but it can be difficult to describe what exactly Heatsync is.  The Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner.  It is a device which can make your dreams reality before your eyes.    \n\nBy taking the rep rap out to schools and to First Friday's and other events we will be able to gain real mindshare and marketing at the same time we gain a valuable prototyping tool.  \n\nBecause a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important to be able to locate your nearest Rep Rap neighbor.  To this end the Rep Rap team maintain a list of rep raps around the globe  As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona.

We want to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to populations including artists, engineers, students and the community at large.  The value of the space will be as much in the tools as in the connections to be made between members.\n\n\n==Explain the need in the market the project addresses, how the project will go about addressing this need==\n\nMake magazine has seen major growth in a dying publishing market and DIY programming has consistently been popular on TV.  For the last several decades American culture swung towards a broadcast society.  Since the inception of the internet that is changing.  People are more and more interested in creating and sharing something with the world, weather that be a youtube video, art, or a prototype.  \n\nThe phoenix area is full of tech companies and therefore engineers.  Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype your design.  There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market.\n\nTechnical students are more and more becoming disenfranchised with the opportunities available to them in academia.  There was a day many years ago where the only place you could find a 'computer' was in academia, but that time has passed.  Budgets are shrinking which means less investment in anything other than relatively cheap commercial off the shelf technology!   And even this technology is increasingly outdated and barely functional.  Secondarily, Colleges also appear to own stock in bureaucracy so that no cross pollination is allowed to happen.  Students are chased out of labs the second their work is done and not allowed access outside of their specified class hour.\n\nEven historically non technical savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture.  This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC which are full of DIY programming.  Lilypad is an interesting cheap convergence of microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles'  This softening of the electrical engineering field is bringing in demographics previously unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday.\n\n==Describe the steps needed to successfully launch the project==\n\n*nonprofit-in progress\n*insurance\n*a space\n*donations\n*tools\n*marketing\n\n[what is a 3d printer, why is it important?]\n\n===Rep Rap(Replicating Rapid-Prototyper)===\n\nCurrently low end commercial 3d fabricators cost upwards of $20,000.   The Rep Rap(Replicating Rapid-Prototyper) is a free to download blueprint to create your own 3d printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in their own words:\n\n*\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant.  Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors?\"\t\n*\"And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nHere's a great single page write-up about the device:<br>\nhttp://www.reprap.org/pub/Main/WebHome/one-page.pdf\n\n[[File:Escher_Drawing_Hands.gif|400px]]\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\n\nDescribe the market in which the project will operate and what barriers there are to market entry, if any. Include an overview of potential partners. Explain the project’s outreach plan. \n\nThis business plan has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace, a list of which can be found at hackerspaces.org.  These groups are all unconnected with some of them private, some non profit, and possibly others for profit.  Generally, a collection of people pay monthly dues between $50 and $75 per month in order to join and use the complex's tools and network with its users.  It is free to list yourself on this list which brings about national recognition to the users of these spaces.\n\nTechshop, http://techshop.ws/, does a commercial version by charging $125/month to mainly attract Startups.  His commercial version has yet to reach Phoenix however.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is capital.  Tools and software are extremely expensive and the problem turns into that of the chicken and the egg.  Without tools, users are unwilling to pay monthly fees, and without fees there are no tools.  Donations will help this as all a company necessarily needs to see is your nonprofit tax deductible status.  The space will attempt to partner with any and all technical companies in order to bring in the capital and supplies necessary to bootstrap the business.\n\nWe intend to outreach to colleges and high schools and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition.  It will also be important to do talks and workshops at the location.  This will bring in additional users to continue the subscription model and continue to build our name presence helping us gain new donors.\n\n\nHopefully it is not obvious to the reader, but it can be difficult to describe what exactly Heatsync is.  The Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner.  It is a device which can make your dreams reality before your eyes.    \n\nBy taking the rep rap out to schools and to First Friday's and other events we will be able to gain real mindshare and marketing at the same time we gain a valuable prototyping tool.  \n\nBecause a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important to be able to locate your nearest Rep Rap neighbor.  To this end the Rep Rap team maintain a list of rep raps around the globe  As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona.

The Rep Rap(Replicating Rapid-Prototyper) is a free to download blueprint to create your own 3d printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in their own words:\n\n*\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant.  Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors?\"\t\n*\"And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nHere's a great single page write-up about the device:<br>\nhttp://www.reprap.org/pub/Main/WebHome/one-page.pdf\n\n[[File:Escher_Drawing_Hands.gif|400px]]\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\n\nDescribe the market in which the project will operate and what barriers there are to market entry, if any. Include an overview of potential partners. Explain the project’s outreach plan. \n\nThis business plan has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace, a list of which can be found at hackerspaces.org.  These groups are all unconnected with some of them private, some non profit, and possibly others for profit.  Generally, a collection of people pay monthly dues between $50 and $75 per month in order to join and use the complex's tools and network with its users.  It is free to list yourself on this list which brings about national recognition to the users of these spaces.\n\nTechshop, http://techshop.ws/, does a commercial version by charging $125/month to mainly attract Startups.  His commercial version has yet to reach Phoenix however.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is capital.  Tools and software are extremely expensive and the problem turns into that of the chicken and the egg.  Without tools, users are unwilling to pay monthly fees, and without fees there are no tools.  Donations will help this as all a company necessarily needs to see is your nonprofit tax deductible status.  The space will attempt to partner with any and all technical companies in order to bring in the capital and supplies necessary to bootstrap the business.\n\nWe intend to outreach to colleges and high schools and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition.  It will also be important to do talks and workshops at the location.  This will bring in additional users to continue the subscription model and continue to build our name presence helping us gain new donors.\n\n\nHopefully it is not obvious to the reader, but it can be difficult to describe what exactly Heatsync is.  The Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner.  It is a device which can make your dreams reality before your eyes.    \n\nBy taking the rep rap out to schools and to First Friday's and other events we will be able to gain real mindshare and marketing at the same time we gain a valuable prototyping tool.  \n\nBecause a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important to be able to locate your nearest Rep Rap neighbor.

We want to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to populations including artists, engineers, students and the community at large.  The value of the space will be as much in the tools as in the connections to be made between members.\n\n\n==Explain the need in the market the project addresses, how the project will go about addressing this need==\n\nMake magazine has seen major growth in a dying publishing market and DIY programming has consistently been popular on TV.  For the last several decades American culture swung towards a broadcast society.  Since the inception of the internet that is changing.  People are more and more interested in creating and sharing something with the world, weather that be a youtube video, art, or a prototype.  \n\nThe phoenix area is full of tech companies and therefore engineers.  Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype your design.  There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market.\n      \nTechnical students are more and more becoming disenfranchised with the opportunities available to them in academia.  There was a day many years ago where the only place you could find a 'computer' was in academia, but that time has passed.  Budgets are shrinking which means less investment in anything other than relatively cheap commercial off the shelf technology!   And even this technology is increasingly outdated and barely functional.  Secondarily, Colleges also appear to own stock in bureaucracy so that no cross pollination is allowed to happen.  Students are chased out of labs the second their work is done and not allowed access outside of their specified class hour.\n\nEven historically non technical savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture.  This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC which are full of DIY programming.  Lilypad is an interesting cheap convergence of microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles'  This softening of the electrical engineering field is bringing in demographics previously unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday.\n\n\n==Describe the steps needed to successfully launch the project==\n\n*nonprofit-in progress\n*insurance\n*a space\n*donations\n*tools\n*marketing\n\n[what is a 3d printer, why is it important?]\n\nCurrently low end commercial 3d fabricators cost upwards of $20,000.   The Rep Rap(Replicating Rapid-Prototyper) is a free to download blueprint to create your own 3d printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in their own words:\n\n*\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant.  Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors?\"\t\n*\"And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nHere's a great single page write-up about the device:<br>\nhttp://www.reprap.org/pub/Main/WebHome/one-page.pdf\n\n[[File:Escher_Drawing_Hands.gif]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\n\nDescribe the market in which the project will operate and what barriers there are to market entry, if any. Include an overview of potential partners. Explain the project’s outreach plan. \n\nThis business plan has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace, a list of which can be found at hackerspaces.org.  These groups are all unconnected with some of them private, some non profit, and possibly others for profit.  Generally, a collection of people pay monthly dues between $50 and $75 per month in order to join and use the complex's tools and network with its users.  It is free to list yourself on this list which brings about national recognition to the users of these spaces.\n\nTechshop, http://techshop.ws/, does a commercial version by charging $125/month to mainly attract Startups.  His commercial version has yet to reach Phoenix however.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is capital.  Tools and software are extremely expensive and the problem turns into that of the chicken and the egg.  Without tools, users are unwilling to pay monthly fees, and without fees there are no tools.  Donations will help this as all a company necessarily needs to see is your nonprofit tax deductible status.  The space will attempt to partner with any and all technical companies in order to bring in the capital and supplies necessary to bootstrap the business.\n\nWe intend to outreach to colleges and high schools and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition.  It will also be important to do talks and workshops at the location.  This will bring in additional users to continue the subscription model and continue to build our name presence helping us gain new donors.\n\n\nHopefully it is not obvious to the reader, but it can be difficult to describe what exactly Heatsync is.  The Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner.  It is a device which can make your dreams reality before your eyes.    \n\nBy taking the rep rap out to schools and to First Friday's and other events we will be able to gain real mindshare and marketing at the same time we gain a valuable prototyping tool.  \n\nBecause a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important to be able to locate your nearest Rep Rap neighbor.  To this end the Rep Rap team maintain a list of rep raps around the globe  As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona.  This would allow us the incredible opportunity of being the Mother of all future Rep Raps in this state.\n\n\n\n==Project Team==\n\nSummarize the entrepreneurial, academic and/or community-focused aspirations, experience, and/or training of the team members. Describe any relationships with advisors and mentors the team will utilize. Provide resumes or bios for each team member in the appendix, if available.\nWe are a team of artists, engineers and makers with a passion for community service.  We have long existed disparate on the web, developing and sharing and we want to bring that culture back home again.

The Rep Rap is a free to download blueprint to create your own 3d printer/prototyper for less than $1000 in commodity parts.  The Rep Rap is perhaps best explained in their own words:\n\n\t\"Today, virtually everyone in the developed world runs their own printing works, their own photographic laboratory, and their own CD-pressing plant.  Moving from two-dimensions to three, why shouldn't they also make their own MP3-players, their own coat hooks, and their own car wing mirrors?\"\n\t\n        \"And why shouldn't they use the machine that does the making to make new improved versions of itself?\"\n\nhttp://www.reprap.org/pub/Main/WebHome/one-page.pdf\n\n[Image of Escher's Drawing Hands here?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Marketing Strategy==\n\nDescribe the market in which the project will operate and what barriers there are to market entry, if any. Include an overview of potential partners. Explain the project’s outreach plan. \n\nThis business plan has been successfully tried around the country and even the world under the title 'hackerspace, a list of which can be found at hackerspaces.org.  These groups are all unconnected with some of them private, some non profit, and possibly others for profit.  Generally, a collection of people pay monthly dues between $50 and $75 per month in order to join and use the complex's tools and network with its users.  It is free to list yourself on this list which brings about national recognition to the users of these spaces.\n\nTechshop, http://techshop.ws/, does a commercial version by charging $125/month to mainly attract Startups.  His commercial version has yet to reach Phoenix however.\n\nThe major barrier to market entry is capital.  Tools and software are extremely expensive and the problem turns into that of the chicken and the egg.  Without tools, users are unwilling to pay monthly fees, and without fees there are no tools.  Donations will help this as all a company necessarily needs to see is your nonprofit tax deductible status.  The space will attempt to partner with any and all technical companies in order to bring in the capital and supplies necessary to bootstrap the business.\n\nWe intend to outreach to colleges and high schools and other tech communities in order to educate and gain community recognition.  It will also be important to do talks and workshops at the location.  This will bring in additional users to continue the subscription model and continue to build our name presence helping us gain new donors.\n\n\nHopefully it is not obvious to the reader, but it can be difficult to describe what exactly Heatsync is.  The Rep Rap in some ways directly displays what we do in a very real, very visual, and very tactile manner.  It is a device which can make your dreams reality before your eyes.    \n\nBy taking the rep rap out to schools and to First Friday's and other events we will be able to gain real mindshare and marketing at the same time we gain a valuable prototyping tool.  \n\nBecause a primary goal of the Rep Rap project is a machine that can build itself, it is important to be able to locate your nearest Rep Rap neighbor.  To this end the Rep Rap team maintain a list of rep raps around the globe  As of this writing our Rep Rap will be the only one in Arizona.

      "text": "Project Concept:\nDescribe the general nature and scope of the project and what products and/or services will be offered:\nWe propose a non profit community center for the modern age.  Accompanied by the internet as a distributor of knowledge, the explosion of entrepreneurism, and the reduction of cost, Maker culture has taken off. We want to expand access to modern, functional, industrial tools to populations including artists, engineers, students and the community at large.  The value of the space will be as much in the tools as in the connections to be made between members.\n\nExplain the need in the market the project addresses, how the project will go about addressing this need:\nMake magazine has seen major growth in a dying publishing market and DIY programming has consistently been popular on TV.  For the last several decades American culture swung towards a broadcast society.  Since the inception of the internet that is changing.  People are more and more interested in creating and sharing something with the world, weather that be a youtube video, art, or a prototype.  \n\nThe phoenix area is full of tech companies and therefore engineers.  Startup costs can be incredibly high in order to gain access to the tools to prototype your design.  There is room here to aid these entrepreneurs in bringing their products to market.\n      \nTechnical students are more and more becoming disenfranchised with the opportunities available to them in academia.  There was a day many years ago where the only place you could find a 'computer' was in academia, but that time has passed.  Budgets are shrinking which means less investment in anything other than relatively cheap commercial off the shelf technology!   And even this technology is increasingly outdated and barely functional.  Secondarily, Colleges also appear to own stock in bureaucracy so that no cross pollination is allowed to happen.  Students are chased out of labs the second their work is done and not allowed access outside of their specified class hour.\n\nEven historically non technical savvy types are taking interest in this maker culture.  This is evidenced at least by networks like TLC which are full of DIY programming.  Lilypad is an interesting cheap convergence of microcontrollers and fabrics into 'smart textiles'  This softening of the electrical engineering field is bringing in demographics previously unreachable.  A perfect place to see this culture in action is at the local First Friday.\n\n\nDescribe the steps needed to successfully launch the project:\nnonprofit-in progress\ninsurance\na space\ndonations\ntools\nmarketing\n\n\nMarketing Strategy:\nDescribe the market in which the project will operate and what barriers there are to market entry, if any.
