title: How to Run HeatSync Labs
type: improved_draft
changes:
  - "Restructured as onboarding guide for new board members"
  - "Added 'First 30 Days' checklist for each role"
  - "Added institutional knowledge notes (accounting, banking, insurance)"
  - "Preserved treasurer notes from Eric Wood (August 2022)"
  - "Moved election timing to April per restructured Bylaws (original: October elections, November transition)"
  - "Added section on community governance philosophy"
rationale: >
  The current document mixes role definitions with accumulated institutional knowledge. Restructuring as an onboarding guide makes it more useful for incoming board members who need both the 'what' and the 'how' of their new roles.

# How to Run HeatSync Labs: Board Member Onboarding Guide

## Philosophy

HeatSync Labs operates on a community governance model. The Board exists to:

1. **Guide the community** - facilitate decisions, don't dictate them
2. **Represent externally** - be the public face and legal representatives
3. **Empower individuals** - help members take ownership of projects and improvements

The Hack Your Hackerspace (HYH) meeting is the primary decision-making venue. The Board executes community decisions rather than making unilateral ones.

## Everyone on the Board Should...

- Attend every HYH meeting (or send a proxy with updates)
- Convert visitors into members through welcoming and engagement
- Support fundraising efforts
- Model the Code of Conduct
- Respond to board@heatsynclabs.org within 48 hours
