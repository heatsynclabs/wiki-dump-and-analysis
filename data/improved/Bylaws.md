title: Bylaws
type: improved_draft
changes:
  - "Restructured into lean 10-article legal framework"
  - "Moved Card Access, Proposal Process, and Code of Conduct to separate Community Policies and Community Standards documents"
  - "Added Article III: Board Member Standards with anti-discrimination/inclusion requirements"
  - "Added Article IV: Member-Called Special Elections (petition mechanism for 8+ members)"
  - "Added Article VIII: Community Governance (do-ocracy principle, policy hierarchy)"
  - "Added dissolution clause (required for 501(c)(3) compliance)"
  - "Added explicit fiscal year definition (January 1 - December 31)"
  - "Added virtual/remote meeting provisions"
  - "Added clear officer removal process"
  - "Added board member indemnification provisions"
  - "Moved Board elections from October to April (aligned with annual meeting)"
  - "Changed officer removal threshold from unanimous remaining officers to two-thirds vote"
  - "Removed Community Relations article (joint ventures, partnerships, asset loans to partnering organizations)"
  - "Reworded purpose statement to align with 501(c)(3) language — original: 'provide a physical space for members and the public to work on projects (especially projects involving physical creation)'"
  - "Simplified officer structure (removed explicit co-officer provisions — original allowed up to 2 Champions and up to 2 Treasurers)"
  - "Removed Quarterly Scholarship provision (Board could grant 3-month free Basic membership for significant contributions)"
rationale: >
  The previous Bylaws embedded operational policies (card access, proposal process, code of conduct) directly in the bylaws document. This makes iteration slow because amending bylaws requires a formal process, while community policies should be adaptable by simple HYH vote. The restructured bylaws are a lean legal framework that references separate Community Standards and Community Policies documents, adds member empowerment mechanisms (special elections), and includes anti-discrimination requirements for board members.

4. Board meetings may be conducted virtually, provided all participants can communicate simultaneously.
5. Votes conducted electronically shall have the same force as in-person votes, provided the voting period and notification requirements are met.

## VIII. COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE

### Do-ocracy Principle

1. HeatSync Labs operates as a do-ocracy: those who do the work make the decisions in their area of work. Members are empowered to take initiative, solve problems, and improve the space without waiting for permission, provided their actions do not conflict with these Bylaws, Community Standards, or Community Policies.

### Role of the Board

2. The Board serves as the legal custodian of the Organization. The Board's responsibilities include compliance with legal and tax obligations, financial stewardship, and enforcement of Community Standards. The Board is not the sole authority over community decisions; it executes and safeguards decisions made by the community.

### Policy Hierarchy

3. The governance documents of HeatSync Labs are organized in the following hierarchy:
   - **Bylaws** (this document): The foundational legal framework. Amended per Article X.
   - **Community Standards**: The code of conduct and accountability process. Adopted and amended by majority vote at HYH; does not require Board ratification.
   - **Community Policies**: Operational policies including card access, proposal process, and other community-governed procedures. Adopted and amended by majority vote at HYH; does not require Board ratification.
   - **Operational Procedures**: Day-to-day procedures (e.g., onboarding, payment processing). May be updated by the Board or any empowered member.

4. In the event of conflict between documents, higher-level documents take precedence.

### Community Relations

5. Members speaking publicly on behalf of HeatSync Labs must accurately represent the organization's positions and values.

## IX. DISSOLUTION

1. The Organization may be dissolved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the membership at a meeting called for that purpose, with at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to all members.
2. Upon dissolution, after paying or making provision for the payment of all liabilities, the Board shall distribute remaining assets to one or more organizations organized exclusively for charitable, educational, or scientific purposes and which qualify as exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or to a federal, state, or local government for a public purpose.
3. No part of the net earnings of the Organization shall inure to the benefit of any private individual.

## X. AMENDMENTS

1. These Bylaws may be amended by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of members present at an HYH meeting, provided:
   - (a) The proposed amendment has been submitted as a proposal following the standard process defined in the Community Policies; and
   - (b) The amendment has been ratified by a majority vote of the Board.
2. Amendments shall take effect immediately upon ratification unless otherwise specified.

---

*This improved draft restructures the Bylaws as a lean legal framework. Operational policies (card access, proposal process) have been moved to Community Policies, and the Code of Conduct has been replaced by the more comprehensive Community Standards document. Both are amendable by simple HYH majority vote, empowering the community to iterate on its own governance without the higher bar required for Bylaws amendments.*
