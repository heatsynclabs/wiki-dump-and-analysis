title: Community Standards
type: improved_draft
changes:
  - "New document replacing the Code of Conduct previously embedded in Bylaws"
  - "Structured around do-ocracy principles: handle it yourself, escalate when needed"
  - "Comprehensive protected characteristics list"
  - "Clear tiered consequences (A-D: warning through permanent ban)"
  - "Grievance committee preserved from current bylaws (1 board + 3 random HYH members)"
  - "Detailed reporting and investigation process with timelines"
  - "Weapons policy retained from current Code of Conduct"
  - "No waiting for multiple complaints language"
  - "Confidentiality and documentation requirements"
rationale: >
  The previous Code of Conduct was embedded in the Bylaws, making it difficult to amend without the formal bylaws amendment process. This standalone Community Standards document is more comprehensive, includes a clear do-ocracy response framework, preserves the grievance committee structure from the current bylaws, and can be amended by simple HYH majority vote per the policy hierarchy defined in the Bylaws.

# HeatSync Labs Community Standards & Accountability Process

**HeatSync Labs exists so people can make things.** These standards protect that mission by ensuring everyone can participate safely. We're a do-ocracy: if you see a problem, you can address it. But some problems need backup. This document tells you when to act, when to escalate, and what happens next.

---

## 1. The Core Principle

**Be excellent to each other.**

This means:

1. **Respect people's right to exist and make things here,** regardless of who they are.
2. **Take care of the space** so others can use it too.
3. **Handle conflicts directly when you can,** and ask for help when you can't.
4. **Support the community's ability to enforce its norms,** even when it's uncomfortable.

## 2. Who This Applies To

Everyone in HeatSync spaces -- physical or digital -- including members, guests, visitors, board members, and anyone at HSL-sponsored events. **No one is exempt.**

## 3. Who We Protect

HeatSync Labs does not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on:

- Race or ethnicity
- Color or national origin
- Gender identity or expression
- Sexual orientation
- Disability (visible or invisible)
- Age
- Religion (or lack thereof)
- Socioeconomic status
- Body size or appearance
- Neurodivergence

*This list is not exhaustive.* If you're being targeted for who you are, that's covered.

## 4. Behavior That Isn't Tolerated

### 4.1 Immediate Removal Behaviors

These result in immediate removal from the space. No warnings.

1. **Violence or credible threats of violence**
2. **Sexual harassment or assault**
3. **Stalking or deliberate intimidation**
4. **Doxxing** (publishing someone's private information)
5. **Theft or intentional destruction of property**
6. **Grossly unsafe tool use** that endangers others

### 4.2 Escalating Behaviors

These may result in warnings, then escalating consequences if they continue.

- Slurs, discriminatory jokes, or derogatory language targeting protected characteristics
- Unwelcome physical contact (you need consent before touching someone)
- Sustained disruption of events, meetings, or others' work
- Refusing to stop behavior when asked
- Repeated boundary violations after being informed
- Creating a hostile environment through patterns of microaggressions
- Retaliation against someone who made a report

### 4.3 Space & Tool Violations

- Using tools you're not certified for
- Leaving messes for others to clean up
- Ignoring posted safety procedures
- Using more space than you need during busy times
- Taking or using others' property without permission

See also: [Rules](Rules.html) for detailed safety and equipment requirements.

## 5. The Do-ocracy Response

> **We're a do-ocracy.** That means you have standing to address problems directly. You don't need permission to say "hey, that's not cool" or "please clean up after yourself." Most issues should be handled this way.

### 5.1 When to Handle It Yourself

- Someone forgot safety glasses -- remind them
- Someone left a mess -- ask them to clean it up
- Someone's being loud during your work -- politely ask them to keep it down
- Someone said something mildly off -- call it in ("hey, that came across weird")
- A tool needs maintenance -- fix it if you can, report it if you can't

### 5.2 When to Escalate

- The behavior is in the "Immediate Removal" category
- You've addressed it directly and it continues
- You don't feel safe addressing it directly
- The person becomes hostile when confronted
- It's a pattern, not a one-time thing
- You witness something happening to someone else who seems distressed

## 6. Reporting & Response Process

### 6.1 How to Report

Choose the method that works for you:

- **Email:** conduct@heatsynclabs.org (goes to all board members)
- **In person:** Any board member or host present at the space
- **Anonymous:** Physical drop box at the space or anonymous form online
- **Direct to specific board member:** If you're not comfortable with the full board seeing the report

### 6.2 What Happens Next

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **48 hours** | Acknowledgment sent to reporter (unless anonymous) |
| **7 days** | Initial investigation complete; interim measures if needed |
| **21 days** | Final decision communicated to all parties |

*Exceptions:* Complex situations may take longer. If so, you'll be told why and given an updated timeline.

### 6.3 Investigation Process

1. **Intake:** At least two board members review the report.
2. **Gathering information:** We talk to the reporter, the respondent, and any witnesses.
3. **Interim measures:** If someone's safety is at risk, the Board may restrict access during the investigation.
4. **Decision:** The Board determines what happened and what response is appropriate.
5. **Communication:** Both parties are informed of the outcome.

**Conflict of Interest:** If a board member is involved in the incident (as reporter, respondent, or close relation), they recuse themselves from the process.

**No waiting for multiple complaints:** The Board is not required to wait for a specific number of reports before taking action. A single credible report of serious behavior is sufficient to investigate and act.

## 7. Consequences

Responses are proportional to the severity and pattern of behavior.

### Tier A: Verbal or Written Warning

For first-time minor violations where the person seems unaware or immediately corrects.

- Documented internally but not announced publicly.

### Tier B: Required Action

For repeated minor violations or moderate violations. May include:

- Apology to affected parties
- Cleaning duty or other community service
- Temporary restriction from specific areas or tools
- Required re-certification for safety training

### Tier C: Temporary Suspension

For serious violations or continued problems after warnings. Duration: 30-180 days.

- No access to space during suspension
- Card access revoked for suspension period
- Reinstatement may require conditions (e.g., meeting with board)

### Tier D: Permanent Ban

For severe violations or repeated serious problems. Reserved for:

- Violence, sexual assault, stalking, or credible threats
- Pattern of harassment despite previous consequences
- Actions that seriously endanger others

If you hinder the Board's ability to conduct investigation or enforcement procedures, that is itself a violation of these Community Standards and subject to consequences.

## 8. Appeals

If you believe a decision was unfair, you may appeal.

### 8.1 Grounds for Appeal

- New evidence that wasn't available during the investigation
- Procedural errors that affected the outcome
- Consequence is disproportionate to the violation

### 8.2 Grievance Committee

Appeals are not reviewed by the Board. A **Grievance Committee** shall be formed consisting of:

- One (1) Board member (not involved in the original decision)
- Three (3) members randomly drawn from those present at the next HYH meeting

If any drawn member has a conflict of interest -- as determined by the quorum at HYH -- they shall be excused and replaced with another random member. The request for committee volunteers at HYH shall be generic, with no names or description of the situation disclosed.

The four-person committee shall review the evidence provided to the Board and the consequence assigned. The committee may **uphold**, **revoke**, or **modify** the consequence.

### 8.3 Further Appeal

If you believe the Grievance Committee's decision was still unfair, you may propose a review of your case by the general membership at HYH. The proposal shall be general with no specific information including name or type of situation. All records will be presented to the membership at HYH for review and a vote (records may be redacted to protect victims).

### 8.4 Timeline

- Submit written appeal to conduct@heatsynclabs.org within fourteen (14) days of the decision.
- The Grievance Committee shall convene within thirty (30) days of the appeal submission.

## 9. Weapons Policy

Weapons are allowed at HeatSync Labs events, community spaces, and in other spaces covered by the scope of these Community Standards. Community members are expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter. Weapons shall be handled carefully, only by those trained to handle them, to minimize risk to guests, members, and themselves.

## 10. Confidentiality & Documentation

- Reports are kept confidential to those involved in the investigation.
- The Board maintains records of all reports and outcomes.
- Consequences may be shared with the community without naming individuals when the Board determines it is necessary for community safety.
- Deliberately making consequences public when the Board has chosen them to be private is itself a violation of these Community Standards.
- If the community needs to know for safety reasons, the Board will communicate appropriately.

## 11. Scope

These Community Standards apply in all community venues -- online and in-person -- as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business. They also apply to behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## 12. Amendments

This document may be amended by majority vote at a Hack Your Hackerspace (HYH) meeting, following the standard proposal process defined in the [Community Policies](Community_Policies.html). Per the [Bylaws](Bylaws.html), Article VIII, Community Standards amendments do not require Board ratification.
