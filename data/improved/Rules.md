title: Rules
type: improved_draft
changes:
  - "Added enforcement ladder (verbal warning -> written warning -> suspension -> termination)"
  - "Added equipment damage reporting procedure"
  - "Consolidated scattered safety rules into unified structure"
  - "Added cross-references to Bylaws for membership and card access"
  - "Improved table of contents and navigation"
rationale: >
  The Rules document is comprehensive (116 revisions of organic growth) but lacks a clear enforcement mechanism and damage reporting procedure. The enforcement ladder provides consistent, fair consequences while the damage reporting encourages transparency rather than hiding accidents.

## 2. General Safety Rules

### Core Principles

- **You are responsible for your own safety.** Verify all equipment setup personally before use.
- **If you don't know how to use it, don't use it.** Ask for training first.
- **Clean up after yourself.** Leave the space better than you found it.
- **Report all accidents and near-misses** to the Board (see Enforcement section).

### Personal Protective Equipment

- Closed-toe shoes required in all workshop areas
- Safety glasses required when operating any power tool
- Hearing protection recommended for sustained loud operations
- No loose clothing, jewelry, or unsecured long hair near rotating equipment
- Long sleeves and welding gloves required for all welding operations

### General Rules

- No working alone on dangerous equipment (lathe, mill, welder) without another person present
- No alcohol or drug impairment while operating equipment
- Know the location of fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and emergency exits
- Minors must be supervised by a parent/guardian at all times

## 3. Equipment Rules

### Certification Requirements

**All dangerous tools require HeatSync Labs certification**, even if you have outside experience. Our equipment may have specific quirks, limitations, or procedures.

Certification is earned by:
1. Attending a scheduled training class, OR
2. Receiving one-on-one training from a certified member

Certified members are tracked on equipment-specific wiki pages.

### Equipment Damage and Reporting

If you damage equipment:
1. **Stop using the equipment immediately**
2. **Post to Slack (#general)** describing what happened
3. **Tag the equipment** with an "OUT OF ORDER" note including your name and date
4. **Notify the Board** via board@heatsynclabs.org

Honest reporting is valued. Accidents happen; hiding damage puts others at risk and is a more serious violation than the accident itself.

### Consumables

Members provide their own consumables (material, drill bits, sandpaper, etc.). Membership does not include supplies unless explicitly donated to the community.

3. **Temporary Suspension:** 1-30 day suspension of membership and access for serious or repeated violations
4. **Membership Termination:** Permanent removal for severe violations or pattern of behavior
